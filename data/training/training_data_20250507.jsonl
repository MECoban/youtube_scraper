(upbeat music) Salary Negotiation, phew. You did it, you've just\nlanded your dream job after so many phone calls,\nhundreds of resumes submitted, dozens of interviews and\nfinally, you got the job. And now you need to negotiate your salary. Maybe you are a little bit\nscared, little bit afraid, little bit intimidated. Or maybe you've been with\nthe company for some time now for a few years, and now you want to go in and talk to your employer\nabout a higher pay, a higher salary. What do you do? You see most of the information out there is sharing with you how\ndo you negotiate salary, is coming from an employer perspective. Today I'm going to do\nsomething very different. I'm going to share with you\ncoming from a CEO perspective how do you negotiate salary? How do you talk to a CEO,\nhow do you convince a CEO? How do you read their mind? You see, the problem\nwith most employees is, they either ask for a\nsalary increase too soon meaning they have not\nestablished a track record, a performance record, what\nthey have done, too early. You see you don't get higher\npay because you demand it. You get higher pay because you deserve it. Or they ask for it too late, meaning they have been with\na company three, four, five, six, seven years but very\nlittle increase in pay. So you don't want to do it too early, you don't want to do it too late. You see as the creator of\nHigh-Ticket Closer program, it's one of the programs I teach\nto people around the world, teaching people the art of closing. How to get people to say\nyes more often to you. I'm gonna take some of those\nideas and I'm gonna teach you how do you actually close your CEO. How do you close your supervisor. How do you close your employer\nto give you higher pay. Salary negotiation tip number one, do not try to negotiate salary\nincrease in text or in email. You see most employees,\nthey're afraid, they're afraid to sit down face to\nface or get on the phone with your employer, talk\nabout your pay increase, because they lack confidence,\nthey lack self-esteem. You don't want to do that,\nbecause when you ask for salary when you're negotiating salary, when you do it through an email it's very easy to\ncommunicate the wrong way. It's very easy to come\nacross too aggressive. Maybe that's not your intent, but reading, you cannot communicate\nyour tone, your emotions. So do your very best, if you\ncould, do it face to face or do it through a telephone. Now you've got all the\ntools working for you instead of working against you. You can use your emotions,\nyou can use your tonality, you can use your body\nlanguage to communicate. Eye contact, to demonstrate,\nto show your confidence, you need to be confident\nwhen you are going into a salary negotiation. So don't be afraid. You wanna practice ahead of the time. Right? To practice multiple times. Maybe with your friends,\nmaybe with your coworkers, your family members. You practiced that ahead of the time. And when you go in there,\nyou've done it dozens and dozens of times. You're ready, whatever\nobjections that you may face, you're ready to go. - I'd like to report a boom, yes. For HTC, I would like to thank everybody for your support, Mr. Dan\nLok for the knowledge, Desmond, Tina, all the team\nand of course to family without you this wouldn't be possible. - My name is Santino Carangi and I am here to celebrate my first three booms of being a High Ticket Closer. So thankful for this course, not only does it give\nyou a high ticket skill or a high income skill, what Sifu teaches you is for life. I am so excited, you guys can do it, keep up the training,\nkeep up the hard work, believe in yourself, kick lower self in the balls, okay. This is your life, go kill it. We are in this for\nlife; HTC for life baby. Season nine fam signing\nout, best of luck to you. We got a billion sales, let's crank it to two\nbillion baby, come on, you are closer than you think. - Salary negotiation tip number two; come to the meeting with\nfacts and not feelings. You see, most employees\nthey make this mistake, they come to the meeting, sitting down with the manager or CEO and they say something like this; well I feel like I have\nbeen around a long time, I feel like I've been contributing, that I feel like I've been\nworking hard, and then, I feel like I deserve more pay. That does not work,\nbecause that's feeling. Well, we don't care how\nyou feel, you gotta come to the meeting with facts. What have you done? You should do your research ahead of time. What are some of the\ncontributions you've made to the company? So when you sit down with your employer, you're not just talking about feelings, you're presenting, kind\nof almost like a case, like a lawyer, and\nlet's say hypothetically you are a social media manager. You manage the company's\nsocial media account. You go to the CEO with facts and say okay since my employment\nhere, here's what I've done. I have grown the company's\nInstagram account by 527% since I was here. Here are the things that I've done. The Facebook page, using\nmy social media strategies and my contribution this is what, how much money I have made the company, how much money I've saved the company. Now the CEO may or may\nnot know these things, so when you present a case,\nnow you're speaking from facts. You are demonstrating, look these are the\ncontributions that I have made to the company in the last one year, two years, things like that. Or, if this is a brand new job\nit is exactly the same thing. Now you're presenting what\nare some of the things that you could do. Right, what are some of the\nthings that your employer, new employer, could expect from you. You are going in instead\nof well, I guess it depends on what you want me to do and I'll do my best to do it, no, you're saying these are things\nthat I think we could do. This is my plan. This is how I'm planning to\nmake the company more money, this is my plan to generate more revenue, this is my plan to\nbring in more customers, this is my plan how I\ncould make things better. You see the difference. So come to the meeting with\nfacts and not feelings. Salary negotiation tip number three, Ask questions, don't make statements. During a negotiation you don't just want to keep making statements. Because it will sound like and\nfeel like you are justifying. You're saying, oh, here's what I've done, and here are the things,\nand here's what's going on, and all those are good,\nyou're presenting your case, but you always want to\nbe asking questions. One of the things I teach all my students, all the professionals\nthat I mentor, is this; Whoever asks the questions,\ncontrols the conversation. So you wanna be asking leading questions, discovery questions, probing questions, you're asking your employer,\nby getting more information, by kinda gauging how they're feeling about the different requests\nthat you might have. Instead of just making\na statement and then it's very easy to turn in to an argument or some kind of conflict when you're just throwing\nstatements out there. But when you're asking questions it would feel much more\nlike a collaboration effort; that we're on the same page, right. As employee employer\nwe're on the same page, how could we make this work? So, ask questions, don't make statements. Salary negotiation tip\nnumber four and that is set the agenda. Don't be afraid to set the agenda. What that means is,\nwhere is this gonna go, what is the purpose of this meeting, what is the outcome, what are we trying to accomplish? As the employee you wanna set the agenda, set the tone, right. What are we trying to accomplish here? What is the outcome we\nwant from this meeting? So you could say something like this, I'm gonna give you a little script; Mr. Employer, you know I'm very excited to be joining your company, I'm truly excited about this opportunity, and I look forward, very much look forward to working alongside\nwith your amazing team. Do you mind if we talk about\ncompensation for a second? See how I ask a question? Oh, not a problem, shoot. Talk about compensation. You see, Mr. Employer,\nbased on my research, for someone with highers,\nwith my background and credentials and my skill sets, the market rate is X-amount of\ndollars, this much per year. How do you feel about that? You see how I'm asking a question, how do you feel about that? Would you be comfortable with that? And then right from there\nthe CEO, the employer, will say well, you know what, yeah that's kinda what\nI'm thinking, as well. Or they might say that's\na little bit more, that's a little bit higher\nthan what we have budgeted for. But then you're not guessing, you're not afraid to say hey this is what the market rate is, this is what industry rate is,\nhow do you feel about that? That's it. You set the agenda. And you go from there. Salary negotiation tip number five, and that is don't be needy. Needy is creepy. You don't wanna sit down, face to face with your employer, and be all needy about what you want. That is a big turn off. So do not use words like,\noh I want, or I need, I see this a lot. Your job pays you $50,000 a year, and you actually wanna make\n$55,000 dollars a year. So there's a five thousand dollar gap. Instead of saying oh,\nI need another $5,000 a year for my position, right. Or I want big vacation\npay, I want overtime, or I need this and I need that, it's a big turn off for the employer. Nobody gives a shit what you need, right. What you wanna do is you want\nto ask questions with finesse. Be on the same page. A much more powerful\nthing you could say is, I would be more comfortable with. You see the difference, I want this, I would be\nmore comfortable with. So example. Let's say the job you want\n$55,000 and the job pays $50,000. First of all you could say well, is there any flexibility with that? Is there any flexibility with that? See how powerful that question is? And then you could say\nthat, you know I would be, I would be more comfortable\nwith 55K a year. Would you be comfortable with that? How do you feel about that? Do you hear the difference? Don't be needy and you\nwanna be neutral, right. When you're in negotiation\nyou wanna be neutral. Neutral, you are friendly but you're firm, you're not attached. The key thing is here, not to be attached. You just, hey, you know\nwhat, I'd love to work here, I would love to contribute, just how can we make this work? Don't be needy. Salary negotiation tip\nnumber six, and that is become more valuable. You see most employees, they want more pay without becoming more,\nwithout adding more value. They think just by working\nmore hours that's more value. Well for certain jobs, like\nlower-level entry jobs, that might be the case, but\nfor certain higher-level jobs, you're not getting paid based on hours, you're getting paid based on results. What you bring to the company, what you bring to the organization. So, as an employee you wanna find ways to always upgrade your skills. How to become more valuable, what can you bring more to the table. Now some CEOs, they're just assholes, I'm talking about CEOs\nwho are true visionaries, who are true leaders. If you sit down and talk to most of them the way that I know\nthem, they cannot wait, they have no hesitation to pay more to competent high performance employees. Because good people are\nhard to find, right. And as a CEO we look for return, we call that return on human capital. If I'm spending a dollar on this employee, how much is this employee\nbringing in for the company? If I'm spending a dollar I'm\ngetting a 10 dollar return in revenue, you would\ndo that all day long. As a CEO I would do that all day long, it's never a problem. And it doesn't matter,\nI'm not just talking about you are in position\nin sales or marketing, in support, admin, operation,\nPR, research and development, it doesn't matter, every\nsingle person, to me, within my organization, every\nsingle person's in sales. Every single person is responsible\nfor generating revenue. Doesn't matter what it is. Doesn't matter video production, doesn't matter social media, doesn't matter it's operation, doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Every single person's job\nis to generate revenue. Now sometimes you can generate revenue by bringing in more revenue, sometimes you generate\nrevenue by saving money by not being cheap; but eliminating waste. That's another way to do it, so you need to find ways\nto become more valuable. One of the mistakes that I\nsee a lot of employees make is they approach this scenario\nwith oh I've been here for five years, I've been\nhere for three years, it doesn't matter. It's not the point. Years don't equal results. Just because you've been\nhere for a few years it doesn't mean a whole lot. On the other hand a new\nperson could come in, if that person could bring a\nlot of value to the company, could generate more revenue, that person would get\ncompensated according to that. So you need to become very, very valuable within the company. Now if you're not so sure,\nsometimes you could ask the CEO, what can I do to bring\nmore value to the company, what can I do? You'll be shocked how many times people do not talk to the\nsupervisor, manager, right. The CEO, what can I do\nto bring more value? They just, they guess, they hope, and they wonder why they do certain things and they don't feel that\nthey're being appreciated, because you're doing\nthings that may not matter to the CEO, right. And I'm not talking about being a suck-up, I'm not talking about kissing ass, I'm talking about becoming more valuable, being more effective, right. Being able to perform better. Being able to do that, and then be very clear what the CEO wants. Be very clear what his vision is and how can you solve\nproblems for him or her. Better yet, how do you solve\nproblems for him or her ahead of the time, before\neven the problem comes up. You do that then you don't\njust become valuable, you become invaluable to the company. When you become invaluable to a company, I promise you, pay's not an issue. Salary negotiation tip number seven, and that is painting a\npicture in the CEO's mind. In your employers' mind. Let's say you're sitting\ndown, you're now negotiating, and you're getting a no. The boss, the CEO is saying to you well, I don't think this is the right time for you to get the pay increase. Now instead of looking\nall defeated and say oh yeah, you know, like, you know, you didn't get the pay that you want, turn that in to a question. Ask, you know, you need\nto sell the employer. What, what is gonna happen. You can't just deserve and say oh I want more, remember don't be needy, what would happen, what would be, what would be his or her expectations. So I'm gonna role play a\nlittle bit with you, okay, just a scenario. So let's say you get a no. What you wanna say is something like this, Mr. Employer, my goal, my\nvision for this company here, for this organization is, I want to be your most\nvaluable team member. I want to be your most valuable employee. That my goal is not to be\nan expense for the company. I want to be a revenue generator. I want you know that whatever you pay me I'm gonna make the company\nfive, 10, 20 times in return. I'm here to contribute. I'm not here to mess around, right. This is not a job for\nme, this is a career. So, Mr. Employer, help me to understand. Right now I'm making\n$50,000 a year, and my goal, my goal is to get to $60,000\na year, or $70,000 a year. Maybe not immediately,\nmaybe there's a plan. Can you teach me, can you\ncoach me, can you show me, can you tell me what would it take for me to earn $70,000 a year. What would be your expectations? And see the minute you say that, now, the CEO is thinking, wow, I have got, I have an\nambitious person here, who's hungry for success, who is not just asking\nbecause, demanding pay, but it's like okay, so how can I help this person\nbecome more successful? How can I help this person to earn the money that\nhe or she wants to earn? Now we are brainstorming. And then now the CEO will tell you, well, you know what, I would\nexpect these things to happen. I would expect these milestones. I would expect these KPIs. And then you say well you know what, Mr. Employer, let's just pretend, suppose I could do this\nand this and this and this and this and this, everything\nthere you've laid out. So you would be comfortable paying me $70,000 a year if I could\ndo all of that for you, is that what I'm hearing from you. And he'll say yeah\nabsolutely, boom, right there, you've gotten the commitment. Maybe not right now, maybe not right now 'cause you still gotta\ndo these things, right, then all you need to do is ask\none simple closing question; Mr. Employer, let's pretend\nI could do all these things, and I'm gonna prove to you\nI could do all of those and more and exceed your expectations, would you be open to revisit\nthis 90 days from now? Now I can book a time\nwith you and sit down and we can, we can talk about this again. Now what are they gonna say? They'll say absolutely, of course. Right there, you've planted a seed. Okay, you're gonna do these things. And what is gonna happen? By the time you sit down you\ndo the same thing again, right. Now even when you get to, now you say from 50K now you're at\n60K, hypothetically, you ask how do you get\n70K, how do you get 80 K, how do you get 100K. Then the CEO is helping you\nto becoming more successful. What would it take. If you're working for a\ngrowing, a high-growth company, the opportunities are limitless. The sky's the limit. There's never lack of opportunities. It's all it takes is your willingness, your ambition, your skills,\nwilling to go that extra mile, willing to go all in, not to be just a typical,\nemployee mentality but to be a team member, to be a high performance individual. Solving problems before\nthat problem comes up. You do that, you don't need\nto ask, I could tell you, all the techniques, all that is good, you don't need to ask for higher pay. If the CEO is truly a good leader the CEO will give you a higher pay. Because you don't need to ask for it. Everybody knows who is\nhigh performance or not. So those are the seven tips on how to negotiate a higher salary.

I am a champion. (exhales) (humming) Okay. How to succeed in sales. You see, when it comes to sales success, it has very little to do\nwith positive thinking. What you want, is positive outcome. You cannot go to the bank\nand deposit positive thinking or your optimism. What you want is that commission check. So let me share with\nyou what I used to do, when I was a loser in\nsales, and what I do today. Check this out. This is an opportunity of a lifetime. I know what our company could do for you, it's gonna be great, you're gonna love it. So do you wanna sign up, like now? Oh. If positive thinking\ndoesn't get the job done, then what do you need to succeed in sales? What you need is a game plan. You see, I don't believe the power of positive thinking. What I do believe is the power of negative preparation. Imagine you're going to a\nfight, like martial art. You can go in thinking positively, thinking that you're gonna win, thinking that, oh, I'm\nnot gonna get punched, I'm not gonna get knocked out. Well, you go in without training, without preparation, guess what? You get your ass kicked. In sales, it's the same thing. I am shocked by walking into\ndifferent stores, right, different sales conversations, dealing with so-called\nsales professionals, how unprepared they are. They do not ask the right questions, they don't know how to\nfind out about my needs, my pain points, they\ndon't know my hot buttons, they don't know anything about me. They haven't even done\ntheir due diligence. They haven't done their research, learning more about the prospect. It is ridiculous. So when I go in, I want\nto be well prepared. Meaning, I want to have a\nplan and the plan is this. A script. Some sort of script that\nI rehearse ahead of time, going into a conversation. That I'm ready, I am prepared. Now you may be thinking,\nbut Dan, if I used a script, won't I sound like a robot? Won't I sound like, too mechanical? I'm not talking about those\ntelemarketer where, you know, they call you and you're saying, like, \"hey sir, how are you today? \"Would you like to buy--\" That's not what I'm talking about. That is using a script all wrong. What a script is designed to do, is give you a game plan. Just like going to a fight, you study the opponent\nahead of time, right? You know what moves they're gonna make. And you prepare yourself. You know what, that person,\nhe is a very strong kicker. Well let's be ready on\nhow to counter that. That person's a very strong puncher. Well, let's deal with that. Let's be well prepared. Another thing you wanna do is, you wanna have an\nobjection handling scripts, meaning that you have every\nsingle possible objection that the prospect could throw at you, and you're well prepared. You know, okay, they're gonna have the price objection, got it. You know they're gonna\nhave the budget objection. You know what, got it, I\nknow how to handle that. They're gonna throw at you\nthe, I wanna think about it. You know what, I know how to handle that. They're gonna throw at you,\nwell, but your competitors charge a lower price. Guess what, no problem, I\nknow how to handle that. You are well prepared. When you equip yourself\nwith something like this, and you go into a sale scenario, you're not relying on positive thinking and hope that you'll get the sale, and hope that the prospect likes you, and hope that you will walk\naway with an agreement, with a deal. No, you know going in,\nthat's what's gonna happen. You're walking in with\nconfidence and clarity. It's not about relying on hope or luck. Oh today, you get lucky\nand a good prospect will walk through the door. Hell no. Hell no. You know exactly what is gonna happen, and you know what the outcome is gonna be. So, get yourself ready. Let me show you how to close a deal. I can appreciate that, and\nI know that our competitors charge a little bit less, right. They're always discounting their services. Why do you think they always\ndiscount their services? See, at the end of the\nday I think the question is not so much about the price, it's about the value isn't it, right? If it doesn't work, I\nmean, I always believe, I'm a business man just\nlike yourself, right. No fee is too high for success and almost any fee is\ntoo high for failure. What we wanna do is make sure that we produce results for you. I want to be a revenue generator,\na profit setter for you, not an expense, does that make sense? So do we have a deal?

I don't think most\npeople would wanna be me. They may think they would wanna be me, but they don't, they don't know. - [Interviewer] Is your\nstorm a happy storm? - No. - I've grown tired of\nhearing the name Elon Musk and not really understanding\nwhat's going on. Who is this guy? Where is he from? How has he built a huge\nbusiness empire to become one of the richest people in the world? And what can we learn about\nhis purchase of Twitter? So I've been going on a deep dive, finding everything I can about this guy, his upbringing, businesses he's started, talking to people who\nhave worked with him, who have worked for him. Many of these people\nwanna remain anonymous for reasons you will soon understand. I've talked to people who\nlove him, people who hate him, people who used to love\nhim and now hate him. - If I were an employee\nat Twitter right now, I'd probably just do your job, don't let him know your name. - So after a few months\nof reporting on this, I feel like I finally have\na handle on who this guy is. I understand how he built his empire, how he treats the people around him, and the real reason I\nbelieve he bought Twitter. - Elon Musk put in an offer. - An unsolicited bid to buy\nthe social media platform. - [Reporter] $44 billion. - So let me show you the\nrise and rule of Elon Musk. - You're a super villain. That's what a super villain does. - [Elon] Yeah. - [Announcer] He's addicted to\ndrama, he's addicted to risk, and whenever things seem\nto be going smoothly, he almost has a compulsion\nto stir things up. (soft music) - [Johnny] Elon Musk was\nborn in the summer of 1971 in South Africa. From a young age, he was\nbullied pretty relentlessly by kids at school for\nbeing scrawny and nerdy. - You know, bullied quite a lot. I got punched in the face many times. - [Johnny] Musk would later say that he's on the autism spectrum, though he was never diagnosed. It got really bad for young Elon. Like one time. - When he got beaten up at school once and so bloody, he had\nto go to the hospital. The scars were actually\nworse when he came home and his father made him\nstand in front of him and berated him for more than\nan hour, calling him stupid, saying it was his fault. - Stories like this make\nme sick to my stomach and you realize that the trauma and scars from this kind\nof abuse, both physical and emotional, they don't go away easily. Speaking of his dad,\nthere's a lot of rumors that Elon came from a rich dad who owned Emerald mines in South Africa and that he was set up to be successful because of family wealth. This isn't factually accurate. Elon's dad did import emeralds, but there wasn't a lot\nof money in this family. - He never owned a emerald\nmine. This is total bull shit. - If you want more detail on that, you can go check out our sources\nwhere we put the fact check for every of the assertions in this video. Anyway, what Elon did have\nat a young age was a skill for computers and programming. (soft music) - [Elon] I taught myself\nhow to program computers, but mostly 'cause I\nwanted to program games. - At the age of 12, he\ninvented a video game. - Mom, do you remember when I was 12 and I created my own video game. - [Johnny] That he sold to a magazine for, - $500. - It was his first business move in tech, his first interest in space. - Around 12 or 13, I had\nkind of an existential crisis trying to figure out the meaning of life. - From an early age. Musk found meaning in\nthe idea of the potential of humanity, what humans\ncan do as a collective, how we as a species have somehow\nbeen able to work together to explore the meaning of the universe. - My motivation was that\nif we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, maybe we can find out the meaning of life. - I mean, you hear this and it\nkind of sounds overly grand, kind of delusional, overly idealistic, but honestly, this is what motivates\nMusk from a very young age and he doesn't bend on what he wants and what he's willing to do to achieve it. So he leaves South Africa when\nhe is 18 and moves to Canada and eventually ends up in\nPennsylvania where he goes to college and gets a degree\nin economics and physics. At the age of 24, he\nmoves out to California to pursue a PhD at Stanford, but he never starts the program. Instead he starts his first business. (soft music) Okay, so I'm not gonna go\ninto the details of every one of Elon's companies\nbecause there are a lot. If you want to deep dive,\nread this very thick book, this was a foundational\npart of our reporting and it details the play by\nplay on all of these companies. For now, let me give you a quick summary of the businesses this\nguy built to become one of the richest men on the planet. His first company was called Zip2. He started it in 1995 with\nhis brother, who seems to have an affinity for cowboy hats. (whip snapping)\n- Yee-haw. - His company provided maps and business directories\nfor online newspapers. I know those words sound\nvery strange to us now, but like back in 1995, it was a huge deal. It almost was like the precursor to what Google Maps is today,\nand it was very successful. - We helped bring online\nseveral hundred newspapers that previously were only in print. - It was acquired a few\nyears later for $307 million, 22 million of those dollars\ngoing right into Elon's pocket. Suddenly Elon is rich. - Receiving cash is cash. I mean, those are just a\nlarge number of Ben Franklins. - He uses the money to start\nanother company called X.com. No, no, no, not that\nX.com, the first X.com, which you now know today as PayPal. - So this is an ATM. All we're gonna do is transform the traditional\nbanking industry. - It was basically an online bank and it was revolutionary at the time. So much so that in 2002, eBay bought it for $1.5 billion.\n(cash register ringing) Elon got 180 million of those dollars, and now he's officially super rich. - There it is gentlemen, the\nfastest car in the world. - So what to do with all of this money? The answer for Elon Musk was to try out the craziest\nideas he could think of. - Oh, I have like about\n180 million from PayPal. I thought, you know, I'll\nallocate half of that to SpaceX and Tesla and Solar City. That should be fine. I'll have\n90 million. Like that's lots. I thought our probability of\nsuccess was less than 10%. It would be foolish to think\nanything else other than that. (soft music) - Ever since he was a kid\nmaking video games about space, Elon has been motivated by this idea of humans expanding outside\nof earth, humans becoming a, - Multi planet species. We would like to help\nmake life multi-planetary. The extension of life to multiple planets. - In early two thousands,\nTesla already existed. They were making electric cars, but there were kind of\nhigh-end niche sports cars. Elon was really interested in this. So he came in as an investor and eventually became\nthe CEO with the vision of turning electric cars mainstream and ushering a whole new\nera of transportation. But these ideas were more\nexpensive than he anticipated. - Things cost more and\ntook longer than I thought. So I had a choice of either\nput the rest of the money in or the companies are gonna die. - His rockets kept blowing up. His electric cars were\ndevilishly complicated to manufacture, but Elon\ndeveloped this addiction to risk and intensity that kept\nhim pushing forward despite these challenges. Tesla reinvented how cars were made. Thanks to innovative technology and manufacturing,\nreally clever engineering and a waterfall of government subsidies. He was able to skyrocket Tesla into one of the most valuable\ncompanies in the world, overtaking every other car company by a long shot in just a few years. And this company was weird. It wasn't obeying all the rules, like there was almost no\nofficial marketing campaign. And Elon decided to make all\nof his technology open source. The patents were not copyrighted. Anyone could see them and use them with the hope that the market for electric vehicles would take off, and that the world would more\nquickly move away from the use of fossil fuels, which would\nultimately benefit Tesla. - So if somebody comes and\nmakes a better electric car than Tesla, and it's so\nmuch better than ours that we can't sell our cars and we go bankrupt, I still think that's a\ngood thing for the world. - These were bold, crazy moves, but they were totally working. Meanwhile, Elon's Space Company was about to go out of business (soft music) - For SpaceX, the first\nthree launches failed. Just barely able to scrape\ntogether enough parts and money to do the the fourth launch. - And then, after six years\nand six months of stress and intensity, Elon's dreams of going to space started to come true. (upbeat music) (cheering) I'm gonna explain a little\nbit more about how he did all of this, but the big deal about SpaceX is that they created a reusable rocket. Every other rocket is disposable. You can only use it once\nand it's very expensive. But Elon proved that\nyou could use a rocket and safely land it back\ndown onto the surface of earth and then use it again. Soon, SpaceX would be\ncarrying NASA astronauts and supplies to the\nInternational Space Station, launching military satellites\ninto space for the Pentagon, launching dozens of\nsatellites up into space for commercial use, and even launching the first\never private space flight for tourism. Space travel was officially reinvented. - I think we're at the dawn of a new era and it's a reason for people to be excited and inspired to be human. - Okay? But what's crazy\nis that during all of this, Elon is also launching a bunch of other companies like\nThe Boring Company, which is trying to revolutionize traffic and transportation by\nbuilding smarter tunnels. Oh my God, it just hit\nme that it's boring, like boring into the side of a mountain. Oh my God, that just hit me, right now? This company also turned\ninto like a blank canvas for Elon Musk to play\nout all of his childish, silly ideas like selling a flamethrower or this perfume that smells\nlike singed human hair. And yes, Musk uses his\nbusinesses as kind of a way to troll humanity while also\ntrying to save humanity. It's this behavior that a\nlot of people find refreshing and ends up getting a lot of attention and becoming a marketing tool\nfor all of his companies. He starts building Neuralink,\nwhich is designing a way for humans to control\ncomputers with their brains, which is already having\nsome initial successes. And now that Elon's company\ncan easily go to space, he starts sending up these\nsmall satellites, 6,000 of them that are orbiting the earth, and he starts providing\ninternet to remote places, arguably changing the\ncourse of the war in Ukraine by providing Ukrainian\nsoldiers with internet during the initial invasion from Russia. Though that's gotten more\ncomplicated in recent months as Russian soldiers have\nstarted to use Starlink and it's a whole other rabbit hole. Okay, but we're not done\nyet with Elon's companies. He also co-founded OpenAI way back in 2015 who went on to make ChatGPT. He later left the company\nover disagreements and then has recently started\nhis own AI company called, you Guessed it, xAI. Yes, the guy loves the letter X. It's literally the name of\nseveral of his companies and one of his children. Each one of these ventures points back to Elon's childish idealism. This grand vision of testing the limits of what humans can do by pushing\nour understanding of physics and working together to\ndo crazy amazing things. But then after building\nall of these companies that are focused on\npushing the physical limits of human potential, Elon in recent years has set his sights on reshaping another industry. (soft music) - [Announcer] Tonight, the richest man in the world is hunting for more. - [Reporter] Put in an\noffer of almost $44 billion to buy Twitter. - [Reporter] All of Twitter. Is this all a troll or is this very real? - Elon Musk has been\nportrayed as both a reckless, unethical billionaire\nas well as a visionary who is changing the world for the better. And what you think about\nhim probably comes from what you read about him. And what you read about him\nwas probably served to you by an algorithm. This is how our media\nlandscape works these days and it's getting us deeper\nand deeper into trouble, which is a major theme in this video, but it's also in line with\nthe sponsor of today's video, which is Ground News. Ground News is a platform\nthat I've been using to navigate this problem,\nto find a balanced view where I can see both\nsides of a news story. Ground News aggregates, tens of thousands of news articles from around\nthe world into one place, and then allows you to critically examine how that news is being covered. Here's a recent story that on the left you can see\nfrom the Los Angeles Times that engineers sue Elon Musk and SpaceX saying that the company mirrored\nhis juvenile, crude X posts. While on the right you've\ngot the New York Post saying that Elon Musk was sued by fired engineers alleging Elon Musk allowed pervasive sexist culture. These headlines have subtle bias in them. Like the left-leaning headline suggests that Musk's personal behavior\nwas directly responsible while the right-leaning\nheadline emphasizes that they were fired employees and that there was an\nalleged sexist culture softening any kind of blame\ntowards Musk and his company. This is really subtle stuff\nthat's hard to pay attention to if you're just scrolling your algorithm. Ground News emphasizes and\nhighlights these biases and allows you to be more\ncritical as a news consumer. Not only do they show\nthis bias distribution, but they also have a tool that rates how factual an article is, and my favorite, they have\nthis blind spot detector that pays attention to the\narticles that you tend to read and presents you with\nstuff that might be outside of your comfort zone, but that you probably need to see to be a balanced news consumer. This is a really cool tool.\nI'm very glad they exist. I'm really glad they're\nsponsoring today's video. If you wanna try this out for yourself, go to groundnews.com/johnnyharris where you'll get 40% off the vantage plan, which is unlimited access\nto all of these features. I use Ground News, I think\nit's really important in today's media landscape. I'm grateful that they\nsponsored today's video. With that, let's dive back\ninto the story of Elon Musk. - [Announcer] Tonight, the richest man in the world is hunting for more. - Okay, so we're getting into this. Why did Elon buy Twitter? What can we learn from it? Before we do that, I want\nto tell you a little bit about what I learned about\nElon Musk as a leader after talking to people\nwho have worked with him, people who have worked under him. There's a few key lessons\nthat I've taken away from all of these conversations\nwe've had with these people and doing research on him. I will not be quoting them directly because most of them\nasked to remain anonymous. (soft music) The first thing I heard over and over again is how obsessed\nElon Musk is with the details of what his companies are building. - [Elon] I think people\nthink like I'm a business guy or something like that, engineering looks like\n80% or more of my time. - [Johnny] One source I talked to who worked closely with Musk, estimates that he spends 90% of his time in technical details with a whiteboard out,\nlooking at code with engineers and programmers, solving very\nspecific details in meetings that sometimes go into\nthe middle of the night. And this gets to our\nsecond takeaway, which is that Elon questions everything\nand I mean everything. You can see this really clearly. When he was building SpaceX, - It was tough going\nthere in the beginning 'cause I'd never built anything physical. I mean, I'd built like\nlittle model rockets as a kid and that kind of thing,\nbut I'd never had a company that built anything physical. - Elon's original idea for\nSpaceX was to buy Russian rockets that had been decommissioned and to rebuild them more efficiently. - I can tell you it was very weird going to the Russian rocket forces and saying, I'd like to buy\ntwo of your biggest rockets. They thought I was crazy,\nbut I did have money. - He went to Russia and quickly discovered that\nthe price that governments pay for rockets is astronomical. It felt absurd. On the flight home, Elon makes this list of every component he can think\nof needed to build a rocket, and then he put in the estimated price for just the materials and the components. What he found is that the prices\nthat they were quoting him for these rocket parts\nwere highly inflated. He interrogated every single\ncost associated with rockets and started to make plans on how his team could find a much\ncheaper way to build them. He did this over and\nover and over until soon his team was manufacturing 70% of all of the rocket components for SpaceX and saving millions of dollars. I heard story after story\nlike this, Elon showing up, talking to some low level engineer, working on some very specific problem and interrogating it until he found the most efficient answer. Oh, and this wasn't about\nhim being collaborative or inclusive of his employees. This is about him stress\ntesting every single assumption, pushing every single thing to the limit so that he can find the most\nefficient way to build something. This also makes working for\nElon incredibly stressful. He'll show up, he'll question everything, and then he'll tell people\nthat a six month timeline needs to be condensed down into 90 days. Everyone's jaw drops. They say it's impossible, and\nhe says it has to be possible and then everyone makes it happen. Which gets me to number\nfour, the people around him. Musk's ruthless idealism and vision for the future\nhas attracted a lot really talented people who bring\nthese dreams to life. These people have rallied\naround his mission to reinvent transportation\nor take humans to Mars. They're the ones who make it happen with unprecedented speed and efficiency. These four things are\nreally his superpowers. They're the ingredients\nthat have allowed him to reinvent entire industries, but this isn't the full picture. Everyone I talk to includes the fact that Elon can be a total asshole and is a lot of the time. - Hate me, like me or indifferent. Do you want the best car or\ndo you not want the best car? (laughing) - [Johnny] He is abrupt, he is blunt, and he puts basically no effort\ninto making you like him. - No, I am not the evil.\nI just misunderstood. (whistling) - One irony I kept hearing\nis that Musk cares so much about humanity, but he doesn't\nreally care about humans. Okay, so I'm the father of an\n11-year-old who is autistic, and I myself identify as being\non some part of the spectrum. And so listening to hours\nof Musk, I see moments that to most people might look\nlike him being mean hearted and arrogant, and extreme, and even cruel, but to me feel more like him being unaware or perhaps unwilling to play\nby the rules of social norms. Okay, but, and because my son\nis probably watching this, I need to make one thing crystal clear that there is a line here. Musk's behavior, especially recently, can quickly cross into\nmalicious, temperamental, mean hearted and harmful\nbehavior that goes well beyond anything that can be justified or explained by\nneurodivergence, into something that looks a lot more like\naggressive bullying, coercion, unethical business practices. - There's almost a demon mode of Elon Musk where he turns really dark and that can be very\nproblematic, especially when it came to acquiring Twitter. - My point is that there's some empathy that is warranted here. It can be a blurry line, but Musk very clearly crosses that line. Something we'll talk about\nmore in a little bit. But for now, let's get back\nto our list, these five things that are the big takeaways\non how Musk operates and how he's built his empire. And let's look at where this\ngot him by the early 2020s. His four big companies had grown rapidly to become worth billions. Tesla reaching a trillion\ndollar valuation, one of the most valuable\ncompanies on earth, revolutionizing the car industry. And by January, 2021, these\nsuccesses has skyrocketed Musk to become the world's richest man according to Forbes Billionaire Tracker. But don't be fooled. For Musk, this actually\nisn't an ideal situation. Musk's biographer, Walter\nIsaacson, wrote this amazing book that details all of this\nprivate communication that really gives us an inside\nlook into the psychology of Musk during this time. And he documents this\nconversation between Shivan Zilis, the director of operations\nat one of his companies, and the mother of a set of Elon's twins, and Elon in a text that\nread, \"You don't have to be in a state of war all the time, or is that where you find greater comfort, when you're in periods of war?\" And he replies that it's a\npart of his default setting. Zilis then tells Isaacson that \"It was like he was\nwinning the simulation and now he felt at a loss at what to do. Extended periods of calm\nwere unnerving for him.\" The guy is addicted to\nconflict and crisis, and tension, and drama. And being the world's richest man with all these successes\nwas uncomfortable. He needed a new storm\nto throw himself into, and so he chose the storm of all storms. (deep music) At the end of 2022, he buys\nTwitter for $44 billion. In his offer letter, he\ntells us why he's doing it. He believes that Twitter has the potential to be the platform for free\nspeech around the globe, and that free speech is\na societal imperative for a functioning democracy. And right away, Musk applies\nhis playbook to the company, sending out a midnight\nemail telling the thousands of employees that there's\ngonna be a new Twitter culture that is quote, \"Extremely\nhardcore, long hours, high intensity.\" And tells anyone who wants to stay to fill out this form or be fired. - Thousands of Twitter\nemployees are being laid off, locked out of their work email accounts. - Twitter has fired half of its seven and a half thousand staff. - We called it the Twitter Hunger Games. - I thought a lot about how\nto talk about Musk's foray into Twitter because it\nis in the news right now. It is shaping the way that we receive and talk about information, and there's a lot of hot takes out there. What I decided to do here is to try to give the most earnest\nunderstanding as to Musk's motives. Why did he do this? What does he want from it, and what is he doing to reshape\nTwitter around this vision? - [Joe] What was it\nultimately that led you to make the decision to do it? - [Elon] It's somewhat melodramatic, but I was worried about that it was having a corrosive effect on civilization. - So first and foremost, free speech is like the\nthing he says over and over. - Free speech. Free speech. Free speech. - Free speech is the only way\nthat humans are gonna thrive. And because Musk's main\nmission is the advancement of human civilization, he must buy Twitter and make it the free speech platform. The platform where we have\nperhaps the most important conversations in the world. He says this over and over like\nin this tweet where he says, \"This is a battle for the\nfuture of civilization. If free speech is lost, even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.\" So that's number one on what\nhe says his motives are. - [Elon] I think part of it is that, it's where it was located, which is, you know,\ndowntown San Francisco. - [Johnny] The next pillar\nof Musk's reasoning has to do with the city of San Francisco. - [Elon] Is there a place\nthat's more far left than San Francisco, Berkeley? - [Johnny] Twitter's headquarters\nis located right here in downtown San Francisco. And for Musk, that's a big problem. - [Elon] It was an accidental\nfar left information weapon that was then harnessed by the far left who could not themselves\ncreate the weapon, but happened to be co-located\nwhere the technologists were. - Okay, so let me get this straight. Musk believes that\nTwitter being in the heart of a liberal city means that the engineers and leaders deciding what gets elevated and suppressed on Twitter are\ninfected with the politics of the liberal city. And so they're more likely\nto elevate their ideology, a megaphone, an information weapon. That's his argument. I have a couple issues with the argument and its logical underpinning, but again, this is about\nwhat Elon Musk says and his motivations for buying Twitter. And number three, the\ngovernment is censoring Twitter and Twitter is letting them. - [Elon] Twitter was simply\nan arm of the government. You know, a state publication is the way to think of old Twitter. It's a state publication. - Alright, this is our list. We're gonna get to each of these and like try to understand them all. But like is anyone else\nwondering what happened here? It feels like the story went\nfrom quirky visionary engineer uses his brilliant unorthodox, socially immature tactics and obsessions to accomplish unprecedented\nengineering feats. To said quirky engineers suddenly dedicates his brilliant\nmind away from physics and towards social media because he believes that\nthere's a deep state conspiracy between San Francisco\ntechnologists infected with liberal bias and their\ncensoring government overlords, and he is going to fix it. (soft music) What happened? I actually never got to the bottom of that and I don't think anyone has. That's actually been a central question that was never answered for\nme during this reporting. We do know this pivot\nhappened sometime in 2020. Why did Musk shift to obsessing over this? The answer to that probably lies somewhere in Elon Musk's brain,\nand it is not ethical or useful for me to try to\nopine on his mental health or what is going on in his brain. So let's stick to the facts. Here is the logical framework that Elon Musk used to buy Twitter. This is what he wants to\ndo with it is fix this. Let's see what happens next. So after firing most of the employees and changing the name\nto his favorite letter, he gets to work on free speech. He lets big accounts that were previously banned\nback onto the platform, including former President Donald Trump, comedian Kathy Griffin,\nlawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene, Jordan Peterson. Within a few months he posts this tweet around the Super Bowl and he notices that this tweet gets less\nengagement than the tweet by President Joe Biden. Elon does not like this. He calls an urgent meeting and tasks 80 engineers to\nquickly rebuild a version of the algorithm that\nwill allow his tweets to be artificially boosted\nby a factor of a thousand. I was kind of skeptical on\nhow sensational was reported, but through my conversations, confirmed that this actually went down. Like the old Twitter was not built to artificially boost one account. And Elon, the free speech guy was like, I need you to boost my account because it's not getting as\nmuch attention as the president and the 80 engineers did. So a few months after buying the company, Elon now has super algorithmic power and he uses it to start\nto amplify certain people. So I know what you're thinking, Johnny, you just disagree with these people and so you think that it's\nbad that Elon let them on, but really free speech is\nabout letting everyone talk. Yes, absolutely. That is true. And yet Elon uses an\nartificially amplified voice to prop up a very specific\ntype of voice on Twitter to amplify ideas, extreme ideas, harmful ideas, not just to\nliberals in San Francisco, but ideas that we as humanity\nrecognize are bad ideas. And now someone with a\nmassive megaphone has control on how big those ideas can get. Even Bill Maher, the Elon fanboy. - There's a very few people who\nactually make change happen. You are one of those people. - Even he could not understand\nwhy Elon was doing this. - I understand why he wanted to like have a platform\nwhere you have free speech, but like why then embrace\nthe worst people on it. - And then Elon isn't totally\nconsistent about this. Like in the case of Alex Jones who spreads horrendous conspiracies and misinformation to a lot of people. When asked why Elon didn't\nlet him go back onto Twitter, he said no. Saying that he had no mercy for anyone who would use the death\nof children for gain, politics or fame. He did eventually reinstate\nAlex Jones after running a poll. But you start to see that\nhe'll reinstate anyone unless he personally takes issue with their views or what they said. What's puzzling to me is that this isn't free speech absolutism. It's not say anything you want. Musk's new Twitter then starts banning and suppressing Substack links, Substack the place where\nindependent journalists write. Musk made the change\nwhere you can't comment or like on anything that\nhas a Substack article and you can't embed tweets\nin your Substack article. That doesn't feel like free speech to me. Musk then decides that the word cisgender\nis a slur on Twitter and threatens to ban\npeople who use it too much. Is that free speech? He then starts banning journalists who criticize him, though he\ndid reinstate a few of them after a vote. And then start suing media\nwatchdog organizations like the Center for\nCountering Digital Hate, trying to silence them for criticizing the new Twitter. Musk, of course, lost with\nthe verdict coming out saying that this lawsuit was basically about trying to silence criticism and deter others from\ncriticizing his company. - He's someone who is willing\nto use his enormous wealth and power to silence people. - Like this is such clear\nanti-free speech behavior. When Twitter users organized\na protest against making users pay for a blue check mark,\nhe banned that account. And this is what's so mind bending. Like I swear he's trolling us here. He says that he's\nobsessed with free speech, but then immediately\nafter taking over Twitter, he demonstrates an extreme\nhypocrisy for that very point. And I secretly think he's doing that so that we are talking about it right now. I don't think it was\never about free speech. I also think that when he\nposts political propaganda ads like this conspiracy video that says that Democrats are letting immigrants in to turn America into single party rule and has almost a hundred million views. I think he's doing that not because he agrees with this\nfactless piece of propaganda, but because he loves to rile people up. Though maybe he does agree\nwith it, I don't know. Either way, he has built a platform that gives him the biggest megaphone and suppresses people that criticize him. That is not free speech. Okay, but let's move on because free speech was just\none of his three major motives. What about this argument\nthat Twitter is infected with liberal ideology because\nit is based in San Francisco? Luckily we have data. This was a great study, very thorough, algorithmic amplification\nof politics on Twitter. It's a study from before Elon took over. They conducted a long\nrunning, massive scale, randomized experiment where\nthey looked at a huge number of tweets from seven countries and they found that in six\nout of the seven countries, including the United States, that quote, \"The\nmainstream political right enjoys a higher algorithmic amplification than the mainstream political left.\" They saw this over and over. Oh, and also a really\ninteresting side note here is that they found that Twitter actually doesn't amplify far left or\nfar right political groups, more than moderate ones, which is a myth that I believed\nuntil I read this study. But the whole point is that old Twitter did\nnot have a liberal bias. If anything, it had a conservative bias. This study is very robust proof of that despite Elon's theory that\nTwitter being in San Francisco infected it with a liberal bias. Go to the sources and read the study for yourself if you wanna poke into it. If there's anything wrong\nwith it that I'm missing, please tell me. But it seems like pretty\nsolid proof to me. Okay, but what about the last critique? And this is a big one. Musk believed that Twitter was\nbeing censored by governments and Twitter was letting them do this. And guess what? That is actually true. Upon taking over Twitter,\nMusk cracked into all of the internal communications and found a bunch of emails that showed how Twitter had banned and suppressed information\nthat it deemed harmful and dangerous, but that\nthey did so sometimes with a political bias. You can see things like\nBiden's team asking Twitter to review these tweets\nthat they didn't like. Yes, governments around\nthe world can ask Twitter to take things down in their country that they think are breaking the law or that are harmful to national security. And this happened on both sides. The Trump White House asked\nTwitter to take things down as well, but this reporting did reveal what looked like a lot\nof left-leaning bias in censoring certain\nhighly sensitive content that would be damaging to the left. The the big example of this\nwas this New York Post article about Hunter Biden's laptop. Twitter severely censored this, not even letting people\nDM the link to each other and making up a thin\njustification for it later. Now, content moderation,\ndeciding what is harmful and what should be censored\nand what shouldn't, is a really difficult task. But for a lot of people, including myself, this crossed a line. This was not okay. Though I have to say that Hunter Biden New York Post article was the most sort of egregious one. A lot of the other stuff in the\nTwitter files was not nearly as black and white. Much more nuanced, much more complicated. The point is there should\nbe transparency here, and I agree with Musk on that. Okay, but this is once again where we find some strange paradox that doesn't make any sense, which is that since Musk took over, government censorship\non Twitter has gone up. Twitter suspended multiple journalists from prominent outlets\nincluded the Washington Post, the New York Times, and CNN. - Tonight, a number of high profile journalists\nhave been silenced. - Here are the number of take\ndown requests that governments around the world made to\nTwitter in the six months before Musk took over. And these are the ones\nthat Twitter complied with. Twitter would fully comply with the government's censorship request about half of the time. The other half of the time they'd say no. In the six months after Musk, the number of requests went up,\nprobably because Musk got rid of a lot of the automatic moderation. But look, Musk's Twitter now says yes to government censorship\nover 80% of the time, way more than the old Twitter. Wait, what? And look, the kind of\nstuff that Musk is allowing to be censored on the platform\nis really sensitive stuff for free speech. Like take Turkey for example. There was a Turkish election last year. The president of Turkey,\nhimself, a massive user of state censorship, pressured Twitter to block the accounts of a\nfew people he didn't like, a Kurdish businessman, an\ninvestigative journalist, both of them vocal\ncritics of the president. Like this is like clear black and white political censorship\nin an election year. Like make the guy who is criticizing me go away. And guess what? Musk's Twitter did it. They said yes. They banned the accounts and then said we didn't have a choice. They were gonna shut down all of Twitter so we had to do it. And then they patted\nthemselves on the back about how they were\nstill trying to fight it, and they're doing so much for\nbattling government censorship and transparency on the platform. But guess what? They did have a choice. This same kind of thing happened\nbefore Musk ever came in and Twitter fought back. In a previous Turkish election, the government tried to do the same thing, censor posts about corruption\nwithin the Turkish government. They asked Twitter to take these down and Twitter said, no. They fired back that political speech is among the most important speech, especially when it concerns\nmatters of possible corruption. So Turkey shut down Twitter,\nit was down for a couple of weeks while they\nbattled it out in court and the Turkish government lost. Indeed, they lost because they were trying\nto censor political speech and Twitter fought back. There's even more recent\nexamples like Wikipedia or Wokipedia as Elon calls\nit, refusing to comply with the Turkish government\ncensorship requests, getting completely shut down\nfor almost three years only to have it be overturned\nin Turkish courts. A major win for free speech in Turkey, which is something that's\nin short supply lately. So like Wikipedia, Twitter can do this. They can say no to the Turkish government if they're actually\ncrusaders for free speech and they're actually against\ngovernment censorship, they would have said no in 2023. Musk's Twitter did this in India too, when the Indian government\nasked Twitter to censor a bunch of journalists, including\nan entire BBC bureau and a documentary that was critical of the government and the\npresident, and Twitter complied. Elon, where is your\nconviction for free speech? Where is your hate for\ngovernment censorship in moments like this where\nit really, really matters? But for Elon Musk, he's got a lot of other things he needs to think about. He needs to think about\nthe market for Teslas, who might be buying his\nsatellites or rockets. He needs to be thinking about where Tesla factories might be set up, the market for his electric cars. This is a conflict of\ninterest that gets in the way of his idealistic vision for free speech and his hate for government censorship. Twitter used to have a page where they would publish in detail why they would take down\nany content they took down at the request of the government. And there's this research lab at Harvard that would aggregate all\nof this for the public. When our story producer\nAlex went to go look for these government requests from Turkey and India, she found that\nthey no longer were there. This page had gone quiet. So she reached out to the Harvard\nlab and got this response. Twitter stopped sharing this\ndata starting in April, 2023. No more transparency on\ngovernment censorship. It looks like it's down to the\nwhims of one super rich dude. That is not free speech,\nthat is the antithesis of what this guy said he was going to build. So no, I don't think Elon Musk is earnest about these three things\nthat he said were his motive for buying Twitter. In fact, after looking into all of this, I'm having a hard time figuring out what Elon is earnest about\nat all, other than his belief that humans have the potential\nto do amazing things. I do believe that in all of\nthis, that is the one thing that has stayed consistent. But how he's pursuing that goal and that vision in recent\nyears is baffling, confusing and in my mind, quite\nharmful to our society. Twitter seems much more like a platform where he can bully the\npeople he doesn't like. He can feed his addiction to crisis and controversy while also\nshowing a childish hypocrisy in his principles and values. But unlike his other ventures, which you can tell when they're successful because they're physics, the rocket either goes up\ninto space or it doesn't. The car drives or it doesn't. This new venture doesn't\nhave a physical feedback loop that tells him if it's\ndoing good or working. Instead, he's playing with the\ndelicate, precarious nature of information in the internet age, something that is already in crisis and now is being chipped\naway at by one rich dude who gets off on crisis. And what blows my mind most\nis that in the process of all of this, Musk is\nundermining his own dream, his own vision. This is a sentiment I\nheard from the employees and colleagues of Elon Musk. They felt betrayed, like\nthis man pushed them to think differently, to do\nthings that seemed impossible, all in the name of this grand vision of what humanity could be, what\nwe could do as a civilization. And yet in recent years,\nhe seems to be sabotaging that very vision, alienating the people and customers that he needs\nto bring this vision to life. In my mind, Elon has exchanged\nthat vision for controversy and division that forces\nall of us to talk about it. Here we are talking about\nit, talking about him. I think a part of him\nloves that or needs that. And yet after all of this,\ndefenders of Elon will continue to argue that only someone like this could be the one to change the world. - To anyone I've offended, I just wanna say I\nreinvented electric cars and I'm sending people\nto Mars on a rocket ship, did you think I was also\ngonna be a chill normal dude? (audience laughing) - And yeah, I get that the people who change the world\naren't normal and orthodox, they're not nice. But I don't accept this way\nof thinking about Musk today, maybe a couple years ago. But in recent years, Musk has shown it's his\naddiction to crisis and attention that is having a corrosive\neffect on our society, validating and glorifying ways of acting\nthat rewards the worst parts of us, and instead of saving civilization, driving us further apart. (soft music) Hey everyone, thanks for watching this\ndeep dive on Elon Musk. I wanna tell you about our new\nchannel called Search Party. It is a deep dive into\ngeopolitics and sports. It is started by Sam\nEllis, my old Vox colleague who now has a wonderful\nchannel that we collaborate on and it is awesome. Go check it out. Thank you\neveryone over at The Newsroom, which is on Patreon, the people who support our deep dive\nreporting every month. I really appreciate your support. Patreon.com/johnnyharris\nif you wanna go check out the perks there. We also still have a few\nhundred copies of this poster that I designed a few\nmonths ago, maybe last year. And it is still around,\na few hundred copies left if you want to go buy them. If they still exist at this point, they could be sold out. It is a poster of all the map projections and it's called All Maps Are Wrong, and I'm very proud of it. You can have it on your\nwall like I have it on mine.

Up here in the northwest\ncorner of Saudi Arabia. (suspense music) It's quiet up here. All you can hear is the wind and the sand that it whips\noff these endless dunes. (suspense music) But not far from where I\nsleep there's a new sound. (suspense music) For years I've been hearing about this trillion dollar futuristic city that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nis building atop this sand. (suspense music) They're calling it Neom, and they're investing a huge amount of their vast oil wealth\ninto making it come to life. (suspense music) I've been hearing about all\nthe reasons it can't work, how this is all just a\nmirage of royal ambitions. And yet even from space, you can see that they're building it, they're building something. (suspense music) Why would anyone try to\nbuild a futuristic city in a barren desert? That is a question I've\nhad for a very long time, and one I intend to get to the bottom of. So I'm going into Neom to\nsee what it looks like, to get a sense of its scale. We're looking at this\nfleet of dump trucks. The amount of construction\nactivity is insane, and it hasn't stopped as we've\nbeen driving along The Line. The magnitude I've never\nseen anything close. They're building mountains out there. I'm joined by my friend Solom, who was born in a tent out here. He knows this desert better than anyone, every dune, every valley. All the secret water spots hidden deep in red rock slot canyons. I asked Solom to bring\nme out into the desert, not only to get up close on\nthe construction of Neom, but also to show me how\npeople live out here, to introduce me to members of his tribe, how they've survived for centuries. Nomadic Bedouin, who\nrepresent the origin story of this desert kingdom. (Bedouin people laughing) I wanted to put a human face to this collision of worlds, old and new. (lively music) I believe this little shape on the map represents the story of Saudi Arabia, where it came from, how it got here, and why it is attempting to\nbuild these cities in the sand. (lively music) (truck revving) I am officially in Neom, and let me tell you\nwhat I'm seeing so far. (trucks revving) Trucks, trucks, trucks, dump trucks, cargo trucks, trucks carrying excavators, trucks, carrying more trucks. I've never seen so many\ntrucks in my entire life. Oh, and these roads, a\nlot of them are brand new, a lot of them don't even\nshow up on Google maps. Like I'm looking at my phone and I'm just sort of\nfloating in no man's land because these are all brand new roads. This is new, everything\nis popping up so quickly. Ha-ha, there's so many trucks. (upbeat music) All of the sudden Solom turned off one of these pristinely new roads. Why do you deflate the tires? - For the dune. - We're now gonna start driving just... into the desert. (lively music) Wow, this car can go everywhere. (lively music)\n(car revving) Are we going up this dune?\n- Yeah. - Oh wow. (car revving) Whoo. Geez, this is insane. (ambient music) (car revving) It's gorgeous. Okay, now we're really in the desert. (ambient music) (car revving) We found a little canyon to camp in. (fire crackling) And while I thought we'd be eating granola bars or canned\nsoup, Solom had other plans. - [Solom] Have you\ntried camel meat before? - [Johnny] Nuh-uh. - [Solom] You will try it tonight. Hashi is the young camel. - [Johnny] Ah, rice with camel meat. The evening tradition here is to wind down with a cup of coffee. Saudi coffee is unroasted and\ngreen, infused with cardamom. It's a different taste, I like it though. But it's still very caffeinated. Oh, and then after the coffee comes... - Tea?\n- Ah, thank you. Which again is very delicious, but how can they drink so\nmuch coffee before bed? Yeah, I can't drink too much because I-\n- Oh yeah. - The caffeine, I won't be able to sleep. - Yeah.\n- In the morning I'll drink a lot of it.\n- Okay. (ambient music) - Wow. Mm-hmm, wow, I love it. So until what age did\nyou live in the desert? - Maybe until seven. - Until seven?\n- Yeah. - Did you like it?\n- Yeah, I like it. - Yeah.\n- I like it. (ambient music) It's so rare to find families. Real families living in desert.\n- Yeah. - The people that we are going\nto, they are real Bedouins. (Bedouins people laughing) But when we moved to the city... I study. (cars hooting) I go back-\n- Oh, you go back to the desert?\n- Yeah. Even for me, I like like\nto have a job in the city, but I want the Bedoiun life. - Yeah.\n- I want them to stay. - Soon we'll meet the Bedouin nomads who sleep under these stars every night. Look at this night full\nof incredible stars. (ambient music) Wow. (ambient music) The Saudi desert is proving\nto be exceptionally peaceful, despite the army of trucks that, by the way, are still working\nhere in the dead of night. I don't ever stop and haven't for years. (suspense music) It is so silent here. My brain doesn't know what to do about it. It's so silent and... (ambient music) But as the sun rises and Solom feeds me dates and green coffee, oh, and of course more tea, I'm thinking about my mission for today. My plan is to drive all throughout Neom, to all the big construction sites and show you what they're\nplanning on building out here with their initial budget of $500 billion, which has since ballooned to\nan estimated $1.5 trillion. And you're about to see why. So I made it to the coast, and I'm looking at the beautiful Red Sea, which is a very beautiful\nkind of blue in fact. - [Announcer 1] This is Oxagon, the place where ideas\ncan change the world. - [Johnny] Oxagon is planned to be their futuristic industrial city. Half of it built on the water. It'll be a port where\nshipping can connect the world to a bunch of high tech manufacturing, research and logistics. And there's Sindalah, which is gonna be right\nhere on the Red Sea. It's going to be a luxury resort island with plenty of parking for yachts. We picked up a hitchhiker who has been working\non Sindalah for years. How's it looking in Sindalah? - [Hitch Hiker] Finished like 99%. - Really?\n- Yeah. (upbeat music) And then there's Magna, which is actually the name of\none of these coastal villages we've just been driving next\nto that is no longer a village. They've forcibly relocated\nthousands of people for this project. (classical music) Atop the ruins of these villages, the kingdom is building\n12 luxury coastal resorts and communities. (classical music) Hey, just one quick clarification here, all of those visuals are 3D renders. They are visualizations done by Neom to see what they want this to look like. This stuff doesn't exist yet, and I think that maybe is obvious, but it looks so real that I just want to\njust make crystal clear. I'm showing a lot of this stuff from the hype-y promo visuals that have come out from Neom. So that's one thing. Also, check out some of this footage I got while I was on a dune. It's floating around on this dune. This is me shooting from the drone, but suddenly on the other\nside of this massive dune, there are these green circles. When I was planning my\ntrip to Saudi Arabia, I got really interested in these things, but that has nothing to do with Neom, so I hopped on the phone with\nmy new colleague, Christophe, and asked him to go down\nthe deep dive rabbit hole of why there's a bunch of green\ncircles in the Saudi desert. And he did so, and he made an entire video\nabout what he learned. That video is live right now on our new channel Tunnel Vision, I think you're gonna like it. And before we get back\nto the story of Neom, and I show you the Bedouin and show you the rest of this video, which is a total monster of an edit, I need to tell you about today's sponsors. Sponsors are how I'm able to do this, how we're able to spend\nmonths and months and months constructing such a massive video. Today's sponsor is Rocket Money.

So thank you Rocket Money\nfor sponsoring today's video. There's a lot more to this video and this is where it\nstarts to get pretty juicy. So let's dive back into the story of Neom and the Bedouin of Saudi Arabia. (classical music) Built on some pretty wild designs, ideas and concepts, including- - [Announcer 2] A vast\nsubterranean digital community inside a mountain, Magna, the coast of Mia. (classical music) - [Johnny] Yeah, right there is perfect. (classical music) - And then there's Trojena\nup here in the mountains. Yes, there are big mountains here. It's going to be a luxury\ntourist destination for adventure and wellness retreats, complete with an artificial\nlake and outdoor activities like mountain biking and skiing. Yes, I just said skiing. Up here in the mountains it\ngets kind of cold in the winter and snow falls. Definitely not enough for skiing, but enough for them to make\nfake snow and make ski slopes. They're building a manmade lake, in fact, they're doing it right now, I'm looking up at the mountain and seeing the plumes of\nsmoke from the dynamite that they're using to do whatever they need to do\nto build an artificial lake. Oh, and by the way, that's the mountain\nwhere Moses talked to God and got the 10 Commandments\nlike a few thousand years ago. - There is no freedom without the law. (classical music) Who is on the Lord's side? - [Announcer 1] Welcome to Trojena, the mountains of Neom. (Johnny laughing) - This is all so strange. (classical music) And then of course, the one\nyou've maybe heard about. (ambient music) And yes, it's being built. (ambient music) I've been driving along it all morning and I can't really fathom what I'm seeing. I continue to have my mind\nblown at a scale of this. (ambient music) They say The Line is gonna\nbe a futuristic citym that stretches 170 kilometers and run on renewable energy\nand artificial intelligence. They want 10 million\npeople to come live here, like a whole New York city of people inside of this line in the desert. (ambient music) Just the digging alone, the amount of earth that\nthey're moving is jaw dropping. (ambient music) The magnitude is like they're\nbuilding mountains out there and moving so much earth. (ambient music) Now I thought I had seen\na lot of trucks before, but as I drove along The Line, I started to get slightly dizzy. Having a hard time processing\nthe scale of all of this, all of these machines working nonstop, every hour of every day for years. Moving sand, making mountains and carving a straight\nline into the desert. (ambient music) (wind whooshing) All of this seems impossible. So much of the reporting on Neom has been focused on how\nimplausible, expensive and delusional this project is. And that's all well and good if that's what you wanna focus on, but to me that's not that interesting. What I'm most interested\nin understanding is why. (ambient music) We found a little cave\nlast night and camped here. Solom invited some of his friends out. Hey guys.\n- Hi. - How's it going?\n- Good. - This is so cool, right?\n- Yeah, it is. - [Johnny] We all sat around the fire, me listening while they\nlaughed and joked in Arabic. (Solom and friends speaking Arabic) And then began cooking yet\nanother delicious meal. This time, goat cooked in\ngoat milk with flatbread. Wow, this is awesome.\n- Yeah. (Solom speaking Arabic) (ambient music) - Wow, so good. (ambient music) I am admittedly a little groggy after sleeping a few\nnights on the desert floor. We're just sledding down\na massive dune in a car and it's as smooth as butter. (ambient music) Where they're making Trojena\nit's gonna be kind of crazy. To have skiing in Saudi Arabia, right? (ambient music) - That's a big change here.\n- Yeah. - It was like a hiking trail.\n- Yeah. Really? - [Solom] But with this, no, this is new. (ambient music) - Today Solom is introducing me to members of his tribe. Is this them? Hello. It'll be the polar opposite\nof yesterday's tour through Neom's construction. He put on his traditional Saudi clothing so as not to surprise\nthe members of his tribe that he has indeed\nbecome a modern city man. (ambient music) We arrived to a remote patch of desert where a few tents are set up. (ambient music) The elder of this family\nwarmly invites me in. Johnny, hi. To sit for coffee. (Bedouin people speaking Arabic) And then of course more tea. Wow. And at this point, I'm just\nembracing the caffeine. They tell me that the only westerners they've ever seen out here\nare the ones looking for oil. And that it's very strange\nto see me showing up to learn about their culture\nand especially with a camera. So how long have you lived here? - [Solom] This is two months here? - Months?\n- Yeah. - Wow. (sheep bleating) I got to meet their animals, extended members of this nomadic family. (camel grunting) So this family's been here on this site, and they'll move again when\nthe season tells them to. They basically are here grazing their camels and their goats. And God, they've got a beautiful view. Oh my God, those mountains. (ambient music) So wait, he's the shepherd? You're the shepherd? - Yeah.\n- Wow. That's cool. Do you ever get lost in the desert? (Solom speaking Arabic) - No.\n- No, he's a pro. He's a pro on that donkey. These people's lives depend\non moving these animals through the desert in\nsearch for scarce food. (ambient music) A theme I hear from a lot of people who live out here is the... just sense of peace and\nsimplicity that they get, that they realize that the\ncity could never bring. What do you like about out\nhere that makes you stay? (elder speaking Arabic) So when you go to the city... City, no. This is a better life. Man, this sunset is gorgeous. (indistinct chattering) Okay. Yeah, yeah, that's good. (Bedouin prayer music) (ambient music) As the group faces east to perform their fourth of\nfive prayers they do each day, I'm looking west. Just over those mountains, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is digging a giant line in the sand. (ambient music) Working day and night\nto reshape this desert, building their high tech eco city. (ambient music) For most of its history, this was the way of life\nout here on this peninsula. And it may have remained such to this day, but eventually the Bedouin\non this peninsula united, an unbeknownst to anyone, was sitting atop a sea of black gold. - [Announcer 3] Oil in\ncommercial quantities, averaging about 200,000 barrels a day. To handle this huge volume, the expanding program requires an increase of permanent personnel to a total of more than 15,000 Arabs. (ambient music) - [Johnny] Oil changed everything. The kingdom rapidly modernized. - [Announcer 3] The king\nsees the oil development as the greatest single means\nto modernize his country and improve the living\nstandards of his people. - [Johnny] All while still\nmaintaining a deep connection with Islamic law, and the rules and norms of Bedouin life. And despite this rapid modernization, hundreds of thousands of people still maintain the nomadic lifestyle. It is a link to their past. (ambient music) Nice. (ambient music) (Bedouin people speaking Arabic) - [Solom] They're talking about something that they see it these days. The people travel by like bike-\n- Cycling, yeah. The conversation goes into the night and I knew I had to ask them about Neom. Can you ask them what their thoughts are on all the building that's happening? I have to be sensitive here 'cause I'm reminded where I am. Saudi Arabia isn't a place\nwhere citizens, nomads or not, can speak critically about their kingdom. I got nervous looks and vague answers. But one thing is for certain that the Saudi government has been pain in compensating anyone\nwho has been affected by these projects. Out of respect, I decide not to push it, it's not worth it. We're sitting around a\nhuge platter of camel meat and fragrant rice. So where I'm from, there's no camels. - Ah.\n- No camels, I've never seen a camel until yesterday. The elder generously\nshowing his hospitality by finding the juiciest\nchunks of camel meat and fat and passing them to me. Thank you. (elder speaking Arabic)\nYeah. And I'm realizing that\nthis moment is a glimpse into one of the oldest\nsurviving cultures on earth. (elder speaking Arabic) (ambient music) Thank you. (Bedouin people speaking Arabic) The family invites us to\nsleep near their tent. Another night, another sky full of stars. (ambient music) I'm really feeling it, just how fast the change\nhas come to this desert, where nomads whose movement and lifestyle hark back to\nthe earliest civilizations and who are now living a stones throw away from the construction of a futuristic city that is attempting to\ndefine the next chapter of human civilization. (ambient music) It feels like too much to process. (ambient music) I couldn't help but feel worried for this link to the past. (Bedouin people speaking Arabic) (Johnny and Bedouin people laughing) (ambient music) So oil transformed this desert, but soon a problem began to arise. (upbeat music) Slowly the world has\nstarted coming to terms with the reality that, burning oil to run our world is turning the planet into a place that's not\nconducive for human life. (upbeat music) The International Energy Agency predicts that the world will hit\npeak oil demand in 2030, at which time demand will start to fall. (upbeat music) Other predictions say it'll take longer, but everyone agrees that the future of this world is not oil. This is bad news for Saudi Arabia, a country that has nothing but oil. - [Announcer 1] Aramco, the\nstate owned oil company, second quarter profit said\ntumbling by more than a third from last year's record highs. - Oil transformed this desert kingdom into a modern, powerful country. And in order for them\nto retain that status, they're going to need to\nuse the money from that oil to transform themselves again. Enter, Neom. (lively music) Saudi Arabia wants to\nreplace its oil economy with new economies, new industries, some of which they want to invent. (lively music) This kingdom that has been\nhistorically closed is now open, welcoming tourists for the first time. - [Announcer 2] Welcome to\nArabia, get your visa now. - Let's go to Sindalah. I here. - [Johnny] Hoping to attract the world, this is something neighboring\nDubai has done successfully. - [Announcer 1] The spirit of Dubai. - But Saudi Arabia plans to\ndo it on a whole new level. (lively music) I'll tell you one thing, the water here is beautiful. On that note, I was surprised\nat how welcome I felt here. Every person I met\ngreeted me with kindness and eagerness to show me their culture. (ambient music) But it's not just about tourism, Neom is manufacturing,\nsustainability, technology, sports, education, media, and even an attempt to\nreinvent cities themselves. (ambient music) They also want to use all this oil money to stay on top of global energy. All of this hot sun is\ngreat for solar energy. (ambient music) And while driving around, I saw endless fields of wind turbines. (ambient music) And they can use this to make\nnew forms of hydrogen energy that they can ship around the world. (ambient music) And the reason why all these promo videos look like a Hollywood movie is because they can't do this without investors from the outside world. They need people to come live here. - [Wife] So my husband got offered a job for Neom in Saudi Arabia, and we decided to make the move. - [Johnny] They need them to play here, raise children here,\nsomehow have a life here, and most crucially to\ninvest in these projects. - And what are we calling it? - The Line. - The Line.\n- The line. - [Johnny] So not unlike a startup, Neom is pitching the world on this impossible sounding vision with the hopes that people\nwill buy it, invest in it, and make some version of it a reality. (ambient music) So do you feel excited about it Neom? Like-\n- Yes. - Yeah. Why? - I wouldn't do this\nbusiness without Neom. - Oh wow.\n- Before Neom. - Wow.\n- Everyone wanna like check on internet what is Neom. Then they need a tour guide. To have more than 30 tour\nguides working with me. - Wow.\n- So it's a big business now and it's all because of Neom. (ambient music) - [Johnny] So while Solom is seeing the benefits of this project, the effects for others in\nthis region are less certain. We're driving by some of the towns that have been demolished. The people forced to move to make way for the construction of Neom. They were given money to rebuild\ntheir lives somewhere else. But some refused to leave, signing a petition to\nprotest this forced eviction. One even posted to social\nmedia voicing his outrage, a risky move in a place where freedom of speech\nisn't really a thing. Soon he was locked in a shootout with security forces that left him dead. - [Reporter] This is when Saudi officials reportedly handed over the body of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti to his tribe. His family denies the official narrative that Rahim was a terrorist. - [Johnny] At least 47 other villagers were detained on terror related charges, and five of them are now on death row. (ambient music) The scale and riskiness of these projects speaks to the scale of\nSaudi Arabia's challenge. They need something to keep\nthem afloat after oil goes away, so they're betting the family farm on a few massive projects.

About 20% of Americans live on\nthis amount of money or less. I wanna show you the lifestyles of people who make this much money\nversus this much money and everything in between. The reason I wanna look\nat these differences is because of this graph, it's\ngoing up, which is a problem. Let's start with $25,000 a year. All right, so let's say my name is George. I live in Atlanta, Georgia. I am single and I have no kids,\nand I'm looking for a job. After some searching, I found this job as a security guard at a TV studio in downtown Atlanta. It'll pay me $12.50 an hour, which is quite a bit more than the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Let's assume I work 40 hours a week, and I work every week except two that I set aside for holidays,\nsickness, and vacation. This means I make $25,000 a year. At this level, around 29% of Americans earn as much or less than me. So how will I spend it? This comes out to be\njust over $2,000 a month that I have to spend. I gotta pay taxes. That brings me down to\n$1,764 to live on this month. To calculate this next\npart for this income and all of the incomes we're looking at, I used some data from the US\nBureau of Labor Statistics that shows that people\nin this income bracket spend about 41% of their\npre-tax income on housing. I've got about $850 for\nall my housing expenses. That's nearly half my after tax budget. I'll definitely be renting instead of owning a house at this budget. A lot of landlords these days require you to earn three\ntimes more than monthly rent. So I'm probably gonna need roommates if I'm gonna get approved\nfor an apartment. All right, let's look at Craigslist. I really can't afford to live downtown, so I'm gonna look in the outskirts, and I found this place\nright outside the city. This is gonna work and\nit's within my budget for rent and utilities. So how am I gonna get to my job, which is in downtown Atlanta\nthat's 20 minutes away from where I live? And like most American cities, there's not great public\ntransportation here, so I'm gonna need to have a car. Let's just say in this assumption, and it's kind of a big assumption\nthat I already have a car, and let's assume it's this car. It's a 2004 Toyota Solara that I got on Facebook marketplace. Lower income Americans\nspend more on their income for transportation than any\nother segment of the population. The data we'll use says\nabout 15% of pre-tax income is spent on transportation. So that's $313 for gas,\ninsurance, parking, and saving up for maintenance and repairs. We gotta be pretty careful about how much extra driving we do and hope that no big\nmaintenance issues arise. According to this BLS data, I spend about 15% of my income on food that includes both\ngroceries and eating out. That's $313 a month for food. A lot of people think\nthat this income bracket just goes to McDonald's all the time, but the reality is, the average order amount at\nMcDonald's is between 7 and $8. So that will not get me through the month. That will get me through\n13 days worth of food. So I gotta go to the grocery store. Unfortunately, in most lower\nincome areas in this country, there aren't a ton of grocery stores, and the ones that are\navailable are much less likely to carry fresh produce\nor other nutritious food. So I'm gonna see what I can do by stocking up on beans and\nrice, peanut butter and jelly, Wonder Bread, top Ramen, freezer meals. For fresh options, I'll\nbe looking at potatoes and some of the cheaper produce. And no eating out, or rarely, occasionally on\nspecial occasions eating out. If I do, I'll be looking at the value menu at a fast food restaurant. I'll be looking for discounts, checking every price in\nthe convenience store. Okay, but wait, don't I\nget government assistance for food, like food stamps? So from my research, I can see that to get\ngovernment assistance, I need my savings account\nto be less than $2,000. Check. My income needs to be lower than 19,578, and I make $25,000. So nope, I don't qualify. Okay, so we've covered our\nbasic needs of housing, food, and transportation, but I\nstill have a lot of expenses. We hear a lot about healthcare being a massive personal cost in the US, but what does that actually look like? Georgia's Medicaid website says that I qualify for government help, but even with that, I will be\npaying around 10% of my income on health related expenses like medicine, doctor visits, getting\ncare that isn't covered by this government insurance. This is one of the reasons why\npeople in my income bracket live around seven years less\nthan the richest Americans. After all these main expenses, I'm left with a small amount\nof money for everything else, and there's a lot more that\nI need to spend just to live. Laundry, internet connection, cell phone, conservatively that adds up to $105, not taking into account the\novercharges and hidden fees. Like you're starting to\nsee what's happening here. This doesn't add up. Entertainment, fitness, and\ntravel just isn't feasible. I have no emergency\nsavings, no rainy day fund, and live in stress of an\nunexpected car repair, a health emergency. Any of these unexpected charges\ncould be a major setback. I'm probably gonna have to join\nthe huge number of Americans that rely on debt to\nget through the month, whether that's credit card debt or short-term loans with\nhigh interest rates. Maybe I'll need to move\nback in with my parents or take on a second job. Maybe I'll start driving Uber or DoorDash. But what's clear is that my full-time job, which pays much more\nthan the minimum wage, is still not enough to\nmake it through the month. I'm gonna pause the video really quick. I'm excited about the\nsponsor of today's video. It's the first time\nthey're sponsoring a video, and it is Headspace. I started using Headspace\nover a decade ago when I was at college and I was first getting into\nmeditation, and I love it. Headspace is an app, but it's also just a general guide for people who want to get into meditation but don't know how, which\nis what I was 10 years ago when I was starting my\njourney of meditation. First, let me tell you why\nmeditation is important in my life. I find that our minds are like muscles. They're like something that\ncan be trained and reshaped. Meditation is kind of like\nexercise for that muscle. It helps you retrain and\nreshape how your brain works, and there's no spiritual\nor religious requirement to any of this. Good meditation and mindfulness\nare simply a practice that brings more peace into your life. Headspace is a platform, a community, and a guide that teaches\nyou how to do this. It guides you through meditations. The platform has a huge\nnumber of guided meditations, also has this really cool feature where in the morning it\nwill prompt you to watch like a very peaceful,\nthought provoking video that will sort of ground you and give you perspective for the day, all done in this really\nbeautiful animation aesthetic, which I'm super into. For me, Headspace took meditation\nout of like the new age, kind of like hippie spirituality and into like a very accessible, very grounded guided approach. And by the way, mindfulness meditation has\na very, very strong basis of scientific evidence to be very effective in\npromoting a healthy mind and even treating things\nlike depression and anxiety. Something I've actually thought about making a whole video on. Studies have shown that using Headspace for 30 days can reduce your stress by 32%. For now, I wanna tell you that Headspace is offering 60 days. It's like two months for free\nto anyone who uses my link. It's down in the description. There's also QR code here on screen. So go try Headspace out\nfor free for 60 days, see if it's a helpful\naddition to your life. Thank you Headspace for\nsponsoring today's video, supporting our journalism. And with that, let's get\nonto the next income tier. All right, now let's see what\nwe can do with $40,000 a year. Now my name is Simon. I am the representative of\nthe median American income of a single earner. I make $40,000 a year\nas an event coordinator at a country club in Atlanta. My $40,000 salary gives me\njust over $3,000 a month. After federal and state taxes, I'm left with just under $2,700. Using that same data set, my\nbudget for housing is $1,133. I'm kind of filling\nthis one bedroom house. Let's say between rent for\nthis house and my utilities, I'm paying 1,133 for my\nmonthly housing expenses. The country club is kind\nof far from my house, and because there's no\npublic transportation, I'm gonna need a car. I saved up and purchased\nthis 2011 Subaru Forester on Facebook marketplace. I got it for $4,500. So like George, I spend about $136 a month\njust on gas to get to my job. This leaves me with a little\nover $400 for everything else. Guy's gotta eat. What am I gonna do for food? According to the BLS data, someone like me spends\naround $467 a month on food. I typically spend about\n$100 a week on groceries and can use the rest\non a dinner out or two. I've got a Kroger grocery\nstore four minutes away from my house. And at this point, I'm definitely cognizant of\nevery price on these shelves. I'm using coupons, trying\nto get the best deal, but I have leeway to\nspend a little bit more on maybe a decent cut of\nmeat or some fresh produce. Maybe I buy organic every once in a while. I can comfortably feed myself if I'm smart about how I spend\nand I don't eat out too much. This income level is\nright on the threshold where employers start to\nsponsor your healthcare plan, they start to subsidize it. That's a thing here in America, and luckily my employer does, but even still, I spend\n$300 a month on health, medicine, out-of-pocket doctors,\npre-deductible expenses, and now I get to pay for a gym. I signed up for this low cost\ngym for 10 bucks a month. So after covering these basic needs, I have $231 left for everything else, all of my other essentials, laundry, cell phone, internet\nbrings me down to $126. I will try to put some of\nthis away for an emergency or a trip, put it into a savings account with a good interest rate\nso it'll grow over time. But to be honest, I'm probably gonna spend\nthis on entertainment. Like I want to go out and have fun. I wanna go to a movie. I want to subscribe to Hulu and Netflix. I might buy a book, might\ngo out with some friends, and after all of that,\nI end up around zero. So all in all, I'm doing\nbetter than George, but not that much better. I've got some money left\nover at the end of the month, but an emergency expense\nwould still leave me in debt. All right, let's up\nthis to 100 grand a year and see what our budget looks like. Okay, now I'm Tim, and I\njust found this job in sales. It makes me $100,000 a year. I'm officially in the six figures. I make four times more than George and double the median\nincome that Simon makes. I'm now near the top 10%\nof earners in this country. My salary gives me $8,333 every month, 2,200 of that is gonna go to taxes, and I'm left with just over six grand. In this income bracket,\nyou see that people spend around 30% of their income on housing. Until recently, this salary\nwould've been more than enough to buy a house, but these days not so much. But for the case of our assumption, let's assume that I, Tim,\nhave been saving for 10 years and I'm finally ready to\npurchase my first home. Zillow is telling me\nthat I can afford a house that's around $314,000. I'm gonna buy this nice one\nbedroom townhouse in Atlanta. It's got these nice wood floors,\nall of this natural light. Oh wait, no. Looks like there's a\ncondo fee, $426 per month, probably for that fancy workout room. Okay, we're gonna have to keep looking. (upbeat music) Okay, I found one. It's a one bedroom condo. It's got a fireplace, access\nto a pool and a fitness room. It's in a pretty good location\nand it's just under $260,000. With the condo fee, I'll be\npaying around $2,700 per month, which is about 32% of\nmy income for housing. I get to spend more on housing than George and Simon make in a month. Oh, and by the way, I will\nhave to cough up $20,000, which is my whole savings\nfor a 5% down payment and closing cost to make\nthis house purchase. Thanks to my good credit, I\ncan qualify for a good car loan that allows me to buy this\nbeauty, a $50,000 BMW. It'll cost me $754 a month for five years, and it will leave me with $579 every month to spend on gas, repairs, and insurance. I'm even starting to be able to afford to bring it to a\nprofessional car wash place, get it detailed every couple months. I am upper middle class now, so I only have to pay 11% of\nmy income on food per month just to feed myself. I get to eat out a lot more lately. When I'm at the grocery store, I get to peruse the\nfresh and nutritious food much more abundantly. I can buy nice meat and nice produce. I'm not overly concerned about the prices. And lately, since meal delivery apps have become more common, I'm ordering DoorDash\nlike once or twice a week. I'm starting to be able to use money to save myself time and stress. My job pays for a lot\nof my health insurance, and yet, I still pay\n$500 a month on health, medicine and these kind\nof expensive supplements I've been buying. I'm able to save money at this point so that a minor medical\nemergency isn't a huge deal. But the doctors I do go\nto have to be covered by my insurance plan. I can't go out of network. It would be too expensive\nto pay out of pocket. With all my big expenses covered, I still have $665 to cover Wi-Fi, unlimited data on my phone. And since laundry and a\ngym are in my apartment, I actually don't need to\nuse much cash for that. So even after all of these essentials, I have money to save and invest, and even still, I have cash left over\nto go out with friends. Every few months, I'm able to save up\nenough to go on vacation. My work pays me even\nwhen I'm taking time off, so I don't need to worry about that. I do have to strategically\nchoose my travel locations to make sure that they're affordable. Because I chose a cheaper place, I'm able to enjoy drinks\nand food while I'm there. When I come home, I do have to save and scrounge for a couple\nof months to recuperate, but it's not too stressful, not bad, and in fact, much better than the vast majority of Americans. All right, now let's up this\nto a million dollars a year and see what our budget\nstarts to look like. Hi, my name is Noah. I am a junior managing director at a big private equity fund. I'm in finance. - I'm looking for a man in finance. - I work 70 hours a week. I make big deals. They're very important. And I am earning $1 million a year. That is $83,000 a month. After taxes, it's more\nlike $48,000 a month. In one month, I'm making double what George\nmakes in an entire year. In three years, I'll make more than he\nmakes in an entire lifetime. I've got some serious\nmoney to work with here. Like I'm officially among\nthe top 1% of income earners in this country, and I'm very lucky because my income and\nwealth are increasing at a faster rate than everyone else's. And we'll see why in just a second. Making this much money, I can get a really nice house\nby spending 28% of my income, which means I can afford\naround a $2.6 million house. Wow, this one's kinda nice. This five bedroom, five bathroom home in\nthis quiet Atlanta suburb. Man, it is nice here. Look at this kitchen. Oh, and this beautiful yard out here. I might pick up croquet. And it even comes with this little friend. Hey, bud. I've always wanted my own taxidermy fox. This house is gonna cost me\naround $19,000 every month for the mortgage and other expenses, like house cleaners that come once a week to clean my entire\nhouse and do my laundry. My yard is maintained by a\nlocal landscaping company. I'm spending 16% of my\nincome on transportation, which means a little over\n$13,000 a month on everything, cars and planes. Instead of owning a car, I\nlease one in three year periods so that I can always be driving\nthe newest fanciest car. Like this Rivian, it's gonna cost me about a\nthousand bucks a month all in. I can totally afford that. I'm also taking a lot of taxis lately because I can afford it, and I can afford a private\ndriver here and there, though I don't have a\nfull-time private driver. I can hop on a flight too whenever I want. And when I fly internationally, I even splurge on business class. Still pretty expensive, but I've got all of these airline miles that I've racked up from\nall of my work travel that I actually get\nupgraded for free often. And now I'm actually pretty hungry, so let's talk about food. My budget for food has ballooned. Based on the BLS data, I could technically afford to spend $8,000 on food every month, but I'm not sure that's totally common among this income bracket. There's not a ton of good\ndata on the one percenters. So I estimate that\nsomebody in this bracket is spending more like\n$3,500 per month on food, which is still a lot. I'm officially deep in the\ndon't look at food prices, don't shop for my own groceries, don't worry about ordering takeout whenever I want kind of rich. I could pay 20 bucks for a salad. I can pay $16 for a smoothie. I could even drop $300 per\nperson on a nice restaurant and not really be too stressed about it. Now, I can't afford a private chef yet, but I have opted for a\nhigh-end meal service that delivers dinners to my house. I have to work a lot. The difference is that per hour, my hours are much more\nfinancially valuable. George, Simon, and Tim all had to spend a lot of their hours cooking and cleaning and traveling around, but I can just pay to get\na lot of that time back. I could technically afford to spend $4,000 a month on health, but again, we estimate that\nit's a little bit lower, more like $2,500, which would still mean a totally\ndifferent healthcare world. I can go to any doctor, I can pay for a therapist out of pocket. I can easily afford to see a specialist for any kind of preventative care, physical therapy, elective surgeries, even stuff that isn't uncovered\nby my very good insurance. I can pay for it. I can pay out of pocket, and\nit's not too crazy for me. And even though I have a gym in my house because I converted one of\nthe mini rooms into a gym, I actually pay for another\nnice gym membership at this luxury spa and gym so that I can use their hot tub and sauna. I also get in on their personal trainers who are really great. I recently signed up for\nthis fancy doctor's office where I pay a monthly fee and I never have to wait more\nthan 10 minutes in the room. Remember, my time is extremely valuable, and this is one reason\nwhy my life expectancy is way up here. I'm probably gonna live seven or eight years longer than George. Laundry, cell phone bills, Wi-Fi, these are all negligible costs for me. I'm left with at least $10,000, and it could be way more if I reduced some of these assumptions, like spending thousands\nof dollars every month on food for just me. So what do I do with\nall this leftover money? Well, I do have a semi\ncomplicated investment portfolio that I love to talk about. My money is in the stock market, 24/7, growing, compounding\ninto more and more wealth. It allows my wealth to grow much faster than those who don't have\nextra money to invest. I go on vacations though they\ndo get interrupted by work. My job is very important. For international trips, I do sometimes splurge\non business class tickets so I can lay down on the flight. What's interesting though is that even at this crazy income bracket, people can still blow\ntheir money every month, trying to keep up with\ntheir expanding lifestyle. But let's be clear, they're\nliving unrecognizable lives to the previous income\ntiers we've talked about. So let's see what happens next. All right, now let's see what happens when we turn this into $25 million a year, which is an amount of money that some people in this country\nactually make every year. Let's see what their budget looks like. My name is Robert. You'll never hear about\nme because I am the owner of a highly successful\nnational car wash chain, or maybe I'm the CEO of Zillow or Chevron, or maybe I'm a pretty famous celebrity, and I make $25 million a year. Noah was already in the\ntop 1% of income earners, but now I am truly in the\nranks of the global elite. And we need to pause and talk about how rich people think about their wealth. At this point, we have\nto start to rethink money because people at this income bracket think less about their yearly salary and more about the total value\nof all of the stuff they own, their net worth. Most of my pay is in stocks, not cash. I spend money knowing that\nI have all of these assets that I could sell if needed, even if it doesn't come to\nme in a paycheck every month, which is actually really great because I'm not taxed on this stuff unless I sell it for cash. And even then I'm taxed at like 15 to 20%, which means that in a lot of years, my tax rate will be less\nthan Tim who makes $100,000. I'm paying less of my\nincome in taxes than he is. This is very good for my net worth. So let's see what I can buy. (upbeat music) Now, given my gargantuan income, I could technically afford this house. It has a pool. It's got this really cool statue and this garden that looks\nlike it's straight out of \"Princess Diaries\". - I don't want to be a princess. - But because I'm planning\nto buy my summer house in Italy this year, I'm gonna go with something\na little bit more modest like this one. (upbeat music) I really like this house. The doorknob in the\nshape of someone's hand, the animal print details, the golf room. I love this golf room. I mean, what can I say? I'm Robert. I'm an eccentric boy. This house has a pool, it's got a gym, it's got this wooden tub, which is something I\nnever thought I needed, but I absolutely do. What you'll start to see with this house and everything else in this income bracket is how it allows me to\nphysically isolate myself from the concerns that most people have. I don't have to think about crime, homelessness, noise, pollution. I can live surrounded only by people who are wealthy like me. Getting around is really easy for me. I've got a couple of cars. I rotate driving them\nevery once in a while, except for this one. This one I don't drive\nbecause it's an antique and I just like to look at it. Oh, and did I mention I\nhave a full-time driver? I pay him $51,000 a year. He whisks me around from important meeting to important meeting. I'm spending two times\nwhat George makes in a year to pay for this, and it's totally worth it\nbecause it saves me time. When I travel, he drives\nme right onto the runway where I jump into a private jet. Now, I don't own this jet yet, but I do charter private flights, like when I need to fly\nfrom Atlanta to New York, cost me about $27,000\nfor this two-hour flight. I can easily do that. 27 grand feels to me what\n$43 feels like to Simon. I'll pay that for a nice private jet. Now, I don't fly private all the time. I do fly commercial if I'm\ngoing on vacation to Paris. I'll be flying first class obviously. I have a separate security\ncheckpoint, my own lounge, and when I get on the plane, I get one of those little\ncabins all to myself. By the way, this ticket costs me $31,000. When I get to Paris, I usually book the penthouse\nin one of my favorite hotels. I have hotel staff\navailable at any moment. Do I cook? No, I do not cook. I enter grocery stores only\nwhen I feel like it would be fun to feel like a regular\nperson for a moment. - Hey chef, do you wanna\ncut this up for her? - And yet, magically when\nI open my refrigerator, everything I need is in there. It's all been fully\ndesigned by my nutritionist, purchased by my house manager,\nprepared by my personal chef. And yes, you can see I have\na whole staff of people who help me manage my life. My house manager is really good at just making this all disappear, like the landscaping gets\ndone, the pool gets cleaned, and a bunch of other stuff\nthat I don't even know. I'm sure all of this costs a lot of money, but honestly, I've never\neven thought about it. I've got my friends over, and our personal chef is putting\ntogether a beautiful meal and he's even doing the\nwine pairing tonight, selected from my collection\nof quirky cult wines in my temperature controlled cellar. I don't pay attention to\nprices for food or wine, except when knowing the price\nof this bottle for example, helps confirm how rare and special it is. I think we spent $16,000 on this bottle, or this other one that I\nsplurged on for $150,000. I go out to restaurants, but it's a little different\nthan the rest of the world. I have connections that allow me to get into the private back room of whatever restaurant I want. Okay, this is insane. And while these costs are very feasible for someone who makes $25 million, not everyone who earns this\nmuch money lives like this. In fact, a lot of super rich\npeople are incredibly frugal making their high earnings\nthat much more impactful because they can get rich much faster. But what we see with Robert is that you actually could\nspend this much money on food and housing given\nyour income, and many do. So in addition to my\nnutritionist and chef, I have a personal trainer and health coach who comes to my house every day and guides me through my workout. He even travels with me to keep me exercising\nwhile I'm on the road. I have a private doctor who is on call who comes to my house. I pay her 20 grand a\nyear just to be on call. She's available, and she'll\ncome do whatever I need, like a quick steroid shot to my bum knee before I play a game of tennis. My healthcare is mostly preventative. I get all the scans and\ntests and routines done to ensure that I'm in tip top shape. I can afford any surgery\nor healthcare routine or procedure that I want. And last year, I fully replaced all of my\nfront teeth with veneers. It only cost me $28,000. And remember, $28,000 for me is what it feels like when Tim spends $112 or what George feels like spending $28, not nothing, but not a huge deal. Even after spending on all of this, I still have lots of money that my financial manager funnels into sophisticated investment portfolios that just keep on growing. Investing can be really\nfun for me at this point. I'll just take 30 grand here and there to buy collectors items that I'm into. A couple weeks ago I paid $5,000 for this authentic World War II helmet. This piece of art costs me 50 grand, but it's a great investment\nbecause the artist is actually gonna be\nthe next big thing, so. This stuff is fun, but it also contributes to my net worth because all of this\nretains and grows in value. And my clever accountant\nhas recently mentioned that he found a way to\noccasionally sell this stuff and get a nice tax break on the profits. Now listen, I make a meaningful difference in my community with philanthropy. Like I'm donating a half a million dollars to my family foundation, which is promoting education in the city. Funneling money and assets\ninto this foundation allows me to get some\nreally nice tax breaks, helps me avoid capital gains tax, and it gives me a buzz of feeling like I'm a\ngenerous millionaire. I even donated a few\nhundred thousand dollars to my nephew's private school last year. They didn't really need the money, but now they're putting my name at the top of their donor list, which\nis like really great. And even after all of this, I've got tons of leftover income. I'm easily able to cover the mortgage on my secondary property in Lake Como. It's only $30,000 a month. And the views here are just chef's kiss. I mean, look at it. One of my favorite parts\nabout this level of wealth is how much access I now\nhave to obscure elite clubs like this one in New York called the Core. I had to pay 50 grand\nfor an initiation fee and then $17,000 annually. But it allows me to rub shoulders with really important people. And yes, there are echelons above me that someday maybe I'll reach, but I'm still existing on\na fully different plane than most every single\nperson in the world. Almost every stressor that you\ncan think of, I can pay away. And the ones that I can't pay\naway, like heartbreak, grief, and social anxiety, I won't be able to pay that\naway at any level of wealth. I am protected financially\nfrom just about any emergency that could occur in my life. And so long as I manage\nmy finances responsibly, I will never experience life\nbelow this level of wealth. The difference between\nthese levels of income, it's kind of hard to fathom. If you're in the $25 million camp, you make more in one hour than\nGeorge makes in six months. In just one eight-hour workday, you're making more than\nGeorge makes in four years. A hundred years ago, the divide between the rich and the poor was incredibly stark in this country. The top 1% would bring home\n20% of all of the income. But then look what happened. We kinda fixed it. We taxed the super rich. The working class organized and rose up fighting for fair pay. And by the 1980s, it was more like 10% of the income went to the top 1%. But watch what happens next. (soft tense music) We're going back up, and we're leaving people\nlike George in a trap. It's not hard to see\nwhy someone like George would have lost faith in our\ngovernment and our institutions and the concept of an American dream. The system is not working for George. Each cost leads to another\ncost, creating a poverty trap with no chance of getting out. Expensive housing far\nfrom work means a car. A car means maintenance\nand insurance and fuel, which means less money\nfor food and healthcare. He makes too much for government\nassistance on any of this. How is George supposed to\nhave the time, the money, or even the brain space\nto think about school or improving his skills? His social mobility is limited. We often think about America\nas this land of opportunity. If you work hard, you can move up. But the data shows us that that\njust isn't the case anymore. For someone like George or for the tens of millions\nof Americans like him, the gap is getting wider and\nit's getting harder to close. And that's bad. Not just bad because it's unfair, but it's bad for our economy. It's bad for our politics. And it's bad for the 44 million people who live in the richest\ncountry in the world, but don't have enough food every day. The people who only have access to credit via predatory lenders, the people whose lives are rocked when they get a $25 overdraft fee or who can't afford an oil change. It's time for the people\nin charge in this country to do what they did a hundred years ago and reverse this curve\nbefore it becomes too late. - [Newscaster] Top 1% hold\nnearly 10 times more wealth than the bottom 50% combined. - A staggering $5 trillion in wealth is set to be passed on\nwithout a dime of taxes. Oxfam is warning this\naccumulation of wealth in the hands of so few could exacerbate political\ndivides, cause corruption, and impact economic growth worldwide. (dramatic music)"}]}

Joseph Smith, leader of 26,000 Mormons, father to 14 children,\nhusband to 40 wives. The prophet, seer, and revelator was dead, and the Mormons were under attack. So they fled. They found safety in\nthe mountains of Mexico where they would go on to build\ntheir own utopian society, building the promised land\nwith its own language, symbols, government, and economy, and a new prophet speaking for God, leading the church's growth, taking 56 wives of his own, and continuing Joseph's vision of building Zion in the mountains. Here in the Wild West, the Mormons would go on to draw this shape as the borders for a state of their own, something that would lead them into a war with the United States government, nearly destroying\neverything they had built. It's a conflict that\nhelped build the West, and it certainly shaped these people, eventually shaping me,\nthe stories that I heard, the culture that I grew up in, the university I attended, the way I saw the world. This is a complicated and sensitive topic, and as always, my\nsources are in a document in the description. Please scrutinize and critique\nthem if you don't agree. I look forward to an interesting\ndiscussion in the comments. With that, let's dive into part two of the \"Rise Of The Mormon Church.\" (apprehensive music) Watching part one of this\nseries will be helpful if you're unfamiliar with Joseph Smith or the establishment of the Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter-Day Saints or the Mormon Church. So this is part two, and\nwe're starting in the 1840s when the Mormons are kicked\nout of Illinois and Missouri, and they make this 1,000\nmile grueling journey into what was then the\nremote mountains of Mexico. - [Narrator] Your forefathers and mine came to this country in the first place for one great reason, to escape persecution for their beliefs, and to build a free country where everybody might\nworship God as he pleased. - Yes, all of this was\nMexico for a very long time. The Mormons believed,\nand still do believe, that someday they would return to the sacred land of\nJackson County, Missouri, where they would help usher\nin the end of the world and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. But for now, they would build Zion in the mountains of Mexico far away from the American\ngovernment and people, or at least so they thought. And this is where things get\nreally interesting to me, because right after the Mormons\narrive to these mountains, they start building, and\nthey start building fast. Hold on a second, lemme\nshow you something. (upbeat music) So when I was at the\nMormon College in Utah, it's called BYU, there was a rule which was\nthat I couldn't have a beard, it's like part of the honor code there, no one's allowed to have facial hair. So when I left, one of the first things\nI did was grow a beard, and I quickly learned\nthat having facial hair is actually more complicated than just like letting\nyour beard grow out. I'm telling you all of this because it has to do with\nthe sponsor of today's video, this very cool little product, it's the Henson Razor. Henson started out making\naerospace machinery and has applied that same\nengineering precision to shaving, and I can tell you,\nit's pretty impressive. They say that the blade extends exactly .0013 inches\noff the shaving plane. So it creates a 30 degree angle, which helps avoid the irritation that is caused by most shavings that has flexible razors. It's meant to save you money. I mean, look at this graph. It's just after a few months that you start to save a lot of money. It's a product that is\nactually literally built to last a lifetime, you buy it once, and it lasts forever. So if you shave, you can get three years\nworth of free razors if you use the link in my\ndescription and the code. The code is \"JOHNNYHARRIS\", and that will get you in on this and three years of free razors. So with that, let's get\nback into this story about the Mormons.\n(upbeat music) They used the same designs\nthat Joseph Smith had drawn up for the city of Zion, placing the holy temple at the center. Around this temple, they would build their\ncity as a perfect grid. But what's most impressive to me is how well they cooperated and coordinated with each other, how motivated they were, how industrious and productive they were. They worked tirelessly\nfor their vision of Zion, and this became a core part\nof the Mormon identity. They ended up adopting the beehive as a metaphor for their community, a group of industrious,\nhighly motivated people, all working together for a common goal. According to the Mormon\nscriptures, the Book of Mormon, there's an ancient word for honeybee, that word is \"Deseret.\" And Deseret would soon be the\nname of their proposed state. And it became a foundational symbol for these people building their Zion in the mountains of Mexico.\n(upbeat music) Okay, but they didn't just build\none city next to Salt Lake. Very soon after arriving, Brigham Young sent members\nof the church north and south to repeat the same pattern, to find an area to build it up quickly with this same grid design, putting the temple in the middle, and begin developing\nand settling this land. (upbeat music) In a very short time, the Mormons spread throughout\nthis mountain west area, building a network of settlements, and displacing native\npeople in a lot of cases, sometimes peacefully with treaties, but other times with violence. I can't emphasize enough how\nindustrious these people were. They were doing things that no one else was doing out in the West. They were building\nsophisticated ditches and canals and reservoirs, getting\nwater into this arid land so that they could farm and grow. They were mining metals,\nthey were very productive, and then they would share\ntheir surplus with one another, because in their mind, Zion was a place of\none heart and one mind, there would be no poor among them, the community was more\nimportant than the individual. Which was the complete opposite of what most settlers\nwere thinking and doing in the American West at the time. Shortly after the Mormons arrive, 1848, thanks to a victory against Mexico, the U.S. gets all of this land, which places the Mormons\nback inside the borders of the United States. But still, the government didn't have a lot of control out here, this was still the Wild West. Most people coming out\nhere were White settlers in search of a new life, pursuing their dreams of freedom, of abundant land, of riches and gold out in the Wild West. And right in the middle of all of this, this group of industrious Mormons, driven by obedience and sacrifice and a commitment to communal living, preparing for the end of the\nworld, for the millennium. This is a tension that will\nblow up in just a second, but first we need to talk about how popular the Mormon Zion was becoming. (jaunty music) Brigham Young had sent\nmissionaries all over, but especially to Europe, to the west coast of England specifically, where these missionaries\nwould preach the word of the restoration of the Gospel and the building of Zion\nin the American West, and it really was effective. When I was a Mormon missionary in Mexico, we would hear stories about\nthese Mormon missionaries out in England who were doing\nthis initial missionary work. And honestly, these guys\nwere like legends to us, they were so successful. The Mormons back in Salt Lake would pool their money together and help pay for the way\nof these new converts across the ocean, across the continent, to come join them in building Zion. My great-great-great\ngrandmother and grandfather were some of these converts from Wales. They were converted by\na missionary in Wales and then made the grueling\ntrek with their children, eventually ending up\nnorth of Salt Lake City where they contributed to building Zion. So for me, and a lot of people who grew up with \"Pioneer Heritage,\" as\nwe call it in the church, these stories of sacrifice\nbecome a foundational part of our belief in our faith. Why else would our ancestors\nhave sacrificed so much to build this church?\n(upbeat music) Brigham Young's society of worker bees started to become more than just a religious\ncommunity in the mountains. They were starting to look a lot more like a theocratic society, with the prophet as the\nhead of their government. They had schools, they had newspapers, their network of settlements\ncreated a complex economy that was run by the church\nwho directed everything, where to build, what to build. Soon they had their own currency. They made these really unique coins, some featuring their\nunique symbols, handshakes, and a reminder that union is strength. Or here we see the beehive again, and a reminder to do your duty. They're building sugar mills and processing iron\nand building factories, and they even invented\ntheir own writing system like their own alphabet, which was meant to unify the people around a common way to\nspell and pronounce words. I actually have a reprint here\nof the \"Deseret Alphabet.\" They never taught us how to read this, which I'm kind of bummed about because I would love to\nknow what this all says. (dramatic music) But there was a big\nproblem for the Mormons, which is that this was\nall now the United States and the federal government was exerting more and more control West as more and more people settled out there. Once again, this could be the end of the Mormon's vision of Zion. So they acted very quickly and decided to propose\na state of their own, telling the government that, \"Hey, we know you didn't like us settling in Missouri or Illinois, but we're out here in the West and we've settled and\ndeveloped all of this land in a really short time. Please let us have our own state so that we can practice\nour religion as we please.\" And what is the state that they proposed, this massive shape.\n(upbeat music) Take a moment to soak this in, look at where we are here. These borders for the\nproposed Mormon state encompass parts of modern day Arizona, Southern California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, Wyoming, and Utah. This thing is huge, if\nit had become a state, the modern United States would\nlook something like this, bigger than Washington, Oregon,\nand California combined, and they would call it\nthe State of Deseret. They were serious. They drafted a constitution and they lobbied hard for their state. And the U.S. government said \"Absolutely not, of course not.\" The government didn't\nlove that the Mormons were building this theocratic society that was completely independent\nfrom the United States. But they did kind of like how\nindustrious the Mormons were, how effective they were\nat settling this land, displacing the natives, and building up communities\nfor White people. This is something the United\nStates was doing at the time. It was their manifest destiny, and the Mormons were really good at it. So, in order to keep the Mormons productively settling the land that they had just won from Mexico, the federal government does\ngrant them this territory, not as big as the State of Deseret, but still a nice big territory. And they let Brigham Young, the prophet of the church,\nbe the first governor. Now, the US Congress did\nnot want to name this after a word from the Book of\nMormon that means \"beehive.\" So they named it Utah, after the local Ute Natives, who this land had been taken from. Little fun side note here, the Washington Monument\nhere in Washington D.C. was built using stones from\nevery state and territory. And as this negotiation was going down, the stone that made it into\nthe Washington Monument says, \"Deseret,\" not \"Utah.\" It's got the beehive and a big eye that says\n\"Holiness To The Lord,\" the most Mormon symbol you could ever have right here in the Washington Monument. (jaunty music) So the Mormons now have a territory called Utah Territory,\nit's not a state yet. President Brigham Young is their governor and their prophet, and they can continue\nto build Zion in peace. But the government now\nsort of has an eye on them. They send in some federal employees to like keep an eye on the Mormons, make sure they don't get too revolutionary with their theocratic government and their apocalyptic ideas. They're once again back\non the government's radar. The government's like\n\"They better start behaving like Americans. They need to quit it with the whole, 'We're making our own\ngovernment and society for the coming of Jesus thing,' or things are gonna get messy.\" (jaunty music) And now, we have to talk about polygamy. Some of you have been\nwaiting the whole time to hear me talk about polygamy. Well, here it goes.\n(playful music) You'll remember from part one that when Joseph Smith was\nthe leader of the church, he came out and said that\nthe Lord had commanded him to take multiple wives, that this was a part of the\nnew and everlasting covenant, which is the law of marriage for Mormons. Joseph ended up marrying around\n40 women in his lifetime, some of them very young. But polygamy wasn't for everyone at first. Joseph invited a few select church leaders and people in his circle\nto participate in polygamy. And they continued doing that. Brigham Young also did this, but in kind of a hush hush way for a bit. That isn't until 1852, a couple years after Utah\nTerritory was created. Prophet Brigham Young stands at the pulpit of this very beautiful building and tells the members of the church that plural marriage or polygamy\nis a divine law from God, a superior way of life, practiced by the prophets of old. And in this conference, he cites Joseph Smith's\nrevelation on marriage, saying that marriage, including\nplural marriage or polygamy, is the only way to be exalted, which is the Mormon way\nof saying to become a God, which is the ultimate\ngoal In Mormon doctrine. The thinking was that plural marriage would allow more worthy\nwomen to marry a worthy man and have the opportunity to be exalted. Brigham Young went on to marry 56 wives. He had kids with 16 of\nthem, 57 children in total. Some of these wives were older widows that Brigham said he married\njust to take care of them, and some of them were 13 years old. So now that the prophet\nhad openly endorsed it, it was public, this was out. More and more Mormon men\nbegan practicing polygamy, taking mostly younger\nwomen as their extra wives. If you wanna look at this graph, pause the video or go look in my sources 'cause it's pretty\ninteresting, but let's move on. So unsurprisingly, the\ngovernment does not like this. Some lawmakers in\nWashington D.C. see polygamy as the equivalent of slavery, something that, at the time, was a fierce debate in the country, something that was about\nto turn into a civil war. And as the government exerts more and more control\nout here in the West, they become less and less comfortable with the Mormons building\ntheir own theocratic, utopia, communal society within the borders of the United States. And Brigham Young, the\ngovernor and prophet, is not helping the situation, writing to his followers\nthat the world is, quote, \"on the eve of revolution,\" giving speeches to his\nlawmakers in Utah Territory saying that, quote, \"The\ngovernment is going to pieces and that when the time comes, we shall be called the kingdom of God,\" like the church is the real government. So is this freedom of religion or a brewing revolution by an apocalyptic religious group? Add to this that more and more Americans are hearing about polygamy\nand are disgusted. You can see this in this\nwaterfall of political cartoons. (jaunty music) Brigham Young at home\nwith all of his wives, all the wives fighting in\nbed while the babies cry, an \"Elders' happy Home.\" I mean, this stuff is kind of\nsnarky and fun or whatever, but you also see some more violent and dehumanizing depictions like Uncle Sam marching\nwith his sword into Utah, the \"Mormon Vermin Nest,\" or lines of women marching\ninto a skull labeled \"Utah.\" The media starts portraying\nMormons as a different race, less White than other Americans. (jaunty music) But the Mormons don't budge on polygamy. It's a law of God, it's\nvery black and white, their prophet has said so. And in fact, they kind of double down. Mormon leaders start defending polygamy saying that it's a healthier way of life. \"Monogamy makes a man dry up and wither, but a man with lots of wives looks fresh and young and sprightly,\" why? \"Because God loves that man.\" Or here's another one, \"Polygamy promotes\nlife, purity, innocence, vitality, and health.\" \"Monogamy engenders\ndisease, disappointment, and premature death.\" Wow, these are in bold claims. Eventually, the federal\ngovernment has had enough. They see this as an open rebellion happening within their borders, and that's when they call in the troops. (upbeat music) War is coming to Utah and Brigham Young prepares his men, calls them back from their missions, rallies his militia to fight back against\nthe federal government that wants to end their Zion. Now, the Mormon militia\ncalled the \"Nauvoo Legion\" is not gonna win against\nthe United States Army. So they resort to kind\nof insurgent tactics. They start kind of terrorizing the supply lines, burning stuff. They create these cattle stampedes, they block canyons, anything to slow the federal troops down. At one point in the middle of all of this, a group of the Mormon militia happened upon a group of settlers who are traveling to California. They have a standoff, and eventually the Mormons\nend up tricking them into coming out and\ngiving them their guns, at which point they go on to massacre almost the entire group, 120 men, women, and children. Only a handful of children were spared, and they were the ones who were too young to remember what was happening. But despite this increased tension, this event known as the\n\"Utah War\" never escalates into a full-blown battle between the army and the Mormon militia. Brigham Young ends up backing down. The Mormons negotiated with the government saying that they would allow the army to come into Utah to\nkeep an eye on things. Brigham Young also had to step down and the government would be\nreplaced with more non-Mormons. So there was a ton of troops in Utah, this time, it's the 1860s, and the Civil War breaks\nout over in the East. And at that moment, the largest group of federal\ntroops are stationed in Utah, keeping an eye on the Mormons. But even still under all of this scrutiny, people keep coming, the Mormon communities keep growing, Mormon men continue to\ntake multiple wives, the government feels like\nthey're being ignored. So back in Washington D.C., lawmakers decide it's time to end the Mormon project once and for all. And this time, they're\ngonna do it with laws. (upbeat music) They pass a series of\nlaws that make polygamy or anything like it illegal. The Mormons are now\nofficially breaking the law, and thousands are rounded\nup and put in jail. And crucially, this law also\ngives the government power to seize the church's\nproperty, like their funds, their buildings, including\ntheir precious temples, the most important place in Mormonism. The government could argue, and the Supreme Court would agree that these temples where\nMormons get married were being used to break the law because they were being used to marry men to multiple women, which was now a felony under the law. Temples were the final\nstraw for this community. It represented what could\nbe the end of their church. So the prophet at the\ntime, Wilford Woodruff, comes out and says that the\nLord has showed him a vision of what will happen if they don't give up practicing polygamy. He said that their holy\ntemples would be taken away. Their men, including their top leaders, would all be thrown into jail, and it would be the end of the church. I mean, he wasn't seeing the future here, this was already happening, and this was logically the\nnext step for the church. So he commands the members to stop. Many members of the church listened and many totally ignored it and continued to practice\nplural marriage for decades. This includes seven of the top\nleaders called the Apostles who continued to practice polygamy even after the manifesto. The church did come out a\nfew years later and said, \"No, really, you have to stop or we will excommunicate you.\" And even still, some disagreed, leading to a group of them to gather in a small desert community in Arizona where they continued to practice polygamy, which they were told was a celestial law. They eventually became\nthe Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-Day Saints, or FLDS, where today they remain, where 30,000 members live in\nthese insular communities, continuing the practice of polygamy. That is a whole other\nrabbit hole for another day. Mainstream Mormons did\neventually get totally on board and do not practice polygamy\nin any kind of significant way. And Utah was eventually made a state. Today, the descendants of\nthose original pioneers live in Mormon communities\nalong this corridor that Brigham Young settled. My wife and I went to school\nright here in the heart of it, in this beautiful valley, surrounded by these massive mountains, feeling close to the\nspecific sugarcoated version of this history that I was taught. These stories of struggle and conflict, sacrifice in the name of your beliefs, bravery in the face of persecution, a work ethic, and a discipline, and an obedience that I was shaped by, huge part of my identity and the identity of a lot of LDS people. But what I've learned\nis that that identity is deeply linked to exploitation\nand apocalyptic thinking, exploitation of Mormon women and children, the theft of native land, obedience to a God whose will is strangely aligned with\nthe incentives of men, a belief that the world will end any day, which justifies all of this. A confirmation that we\nwere the chosen people, the real Israel, called of\nGod to prepare the world for the end, to gather the tribes before the Savior's return. I still don't fully understand how I could find such meaning and beauty in something that I now\nfind to be so wrong, to be so damaging. And yet there's a third and\nfinal part to this story that you have to understand if you want to understand\nthe Mormon experience. I'll eventually be making a third video where I explain a bizarre\npivot that happens where the Mormons go\nfrom being a rebellious, apocalyptic group in the mountains, fighting with the federal\ngovernment, to embracing it, growing the church into\na global organization who has used that same\nbeehive, cooperative work ethic to become wealthy and powerful, wielding over 100 billion\ndollars in financial assets, all with the goal of building Zion in preparation for the end of the world. It's the same goal that\nmotivated Joseph Smith to start the church, the same goal that kept the Saints going with Brigham Young and\nbuilding out the mountain West. And it is the same goal that motivates members\nof the church today. (gentle serene music) Hey everyone, thanks\nfor watching the video. I appreciate everyone who pushed me hard to finally this second part. These are a little bit\ncomplicated for me to make for kind of personal reasons, and so I kind of push it down the line and don't really get to\nit, but I'm glad I made it, I learned a lot, and I tried\nto be generous and factual, while also making it clear what facts I think are really important to understand about this history. I'll be making part three\nover the coming months, so push me to make it if I don't. Make sure to check out our\nnew channel \"Search Party.\" It's not so new, it's a\nyear old actually now. Sam Ellis, my old Vox colleague, is building this awesome channel, sort of helping and supporting, but it's under our network of channels, and he is making some really cool stuff.

More than the next 10 countries combined. But I'm interested in what\nhappens inside of this circle. Like, what are we spending our money on. (intriguing music) (intriguing music continues) In here we'll see everything that the military spends their money on, from salaries for soldiers to elementary schools for their children. (thrilling music) We'll see the $21-million helicopters, and these missiles that\ncost $1.6 million each. And we'll see how much the Pentagon spends on the development of new\nweapons, new technology, like these ship-based laser weapons. And of course, the most expensive of all, the F-35 fighter jet that will end up costing\nthe taxpayers $2 trillion. We even made a little model of this guy and, like the real thing, the model is continually breaking down. No. Okay, here we go. - [Producer] The door thing\nis really hard to put in. - Yeah. Of all the money our Congress budgets to run our government on any given year, almost half of it goes to the military. Here you've got education,\nand there's diplomacy, and health science, energy, environment. We've been deep in the\nspreadsheets and the data, luckily, all this stuff is pretty public and open to scrutiny, with the goal of visualizing all of this, trying to understand where the money goes. To understand why the\nUS spends so much more than any other country on its military. And most important of all,\nto try to answer the question of whether all of this money\nactually makes us safer. - [Sen. Wicker] Almost\nall of our witnesses before the Armed Services\nCommittee tell us that we are in the most\ndangerous global threat security since generations. (gentle music) - This is the Pentagon's budget for 2023. It's how they planned to\nspend money that year. It turns out that how\nmuch they spend on defense is pretty complicated and\ndepends a lot on who you ask, so go to the sources, you can see how we got all these numbers and what decisions we made. The total number we got was $853 billion. That's more than the entire\neconomy of Switzerland. (gentle music) Let's take a brain break because I want to talk about\nanother kind of budget, an annoying part of my personal budget, which is subscriptions. You know what I'm talking about. We all subscribe to things\nthat every month charge us a little bit of money, not enough for us to pay attention to it, but enough to add up over time. There's a lot of companies\nwhose main business model is hoping that you'll\nsign up for something and then that you signed up so that they can charge you every month. This is super annoying and\nreally hard to keep track of. Luckily, there's a solution, and that solution is Rocket Money, who is the sponsor of today's video. You give Rocket Money\naccess to your bank feed, and it fishes out all the\nreoccurring subscriptions that you're paying for,\nand let's you see them all in one place, and you\ncan easily just cancel them. I recently found that\nI have been subscribed to all of these local\nnewspapers that I subscribe to because I need to read a story,\nlike in some other country and I subscribe and\nthen I forget about it, and it's only like three\nbucks a month, but it adds up. I'm subscribed to tons of\nthese, and I didn't know. But with Rocket Money you\ncan see it all in one place. It's so easy. It also saves me time in going through the often cumbersome process of trying to cancel these subscriptions. And one other thing, which\nis that they will help you negotiate your bills to be lower. Like, for example, a lot of us are paying too much for internet. We could get a lower rate on\nour monthly internet bill. Rocket Money knows this, and they know how to get that\nnumber down if it's possible. So it's subscription cancellations, it's negotiating your bill down, and it will just analyze your\nfinances and pull out trends and insights that it sees\nwithin your spending habits.

Okay, now that I've been talking\nabout my personal budget, let's get back to the budget of the military of the United States. It's a lot. So let's\nstart to break it down. (intriguing music) Close to half of all of this money goes to the vague-sounding category of operations and maintenance. This is $352 billion that\nwe spend just on O&M. That's larger than the\nentire economy of Portugal. Like, just to create the report to get all these numbers\nassembled in one place costs the DoD $269,000. But also, credit to the\nPentagon and the US government for giving us all of this very clear data that we can shine a\nlight on and scrutinize. A lot of countries\naren't this transparent. So anyway, operations and maintenance, this is all the costs required to keep the Department of Defense, one of the largest organizations\nin the world, running. It's a lot of not very sexy\nstuff, like transportation, fuel, maintenance of equipment, administrative costs, training expenses. (intriguing music) It includes $39 billion\njust for the doctors and health services for\nactive duty personnel. And it also covers the stuff that you don't really think about when you think of military spending, like environmental cleanup in areas that the military has\nleft unexploded bombs or spilled chemicals in\nthe local environment. It also includes disaster\nrelief and humanitarian money, which is something the\nmilitary does as well. Here's nearly $1 billion\ndedicated to anti-drug activities. And here's $10 million for security at international sporting competitions. This huge category also\ncaptures the cost to run every one of the US's\napproximately 1,250 military bases. (intriguing music) Including the approximately 800 bases that are not in the United States, that are in other countries, which, by the way, are\nquite expensive to run, because the US military\nhas basically created a slice of America in\nthese other countries. You've got Pizza Hut and\nMcDonald's and Subway and grocery stores with products flown from the United States to make military personnel serving abroad feel like they're right at home. Okay, but let's just pause\nright here on this map, because this is a good moment to recognize that the United States\nmilitary is not a normal army. It is not a normal military. (soft piano music) Most militaries are tasked\nwith protecting their country, securing their borders, but the US military is\nso much more than that. It sprawls out throughout\nthe entire globe, giving the US control over\nevery corner of the planet, allowing the US to be\nthe global policeman, where it enforces the rules\nand norms of the system that it created and from\nwhich it benefits immensely. So one quick answer to this big question of why the United States spends\nso much more on its military is actually pretty simple, because this is the cost of\nbeing the global hegemon, the one who gets to enforce the rules and maintain control over the globe. (soft piano music) Okay, but let's keep going on our budget. That's the point of the video. (upbeat music) The next big category here is\npeople, military personnel. $172 billion. (upbeat music) Pay, benefits, retirement, healthcare for the over 3.4 million\nsoldiers, reservists, and civilian military personnel. By some estimates, the\nDepartment of Defense is the largest employer in the world, though it depends on how you count it. The Pentagon also spends a lot of money on recruiting new talent, like the $28 million that\nthey spent on hiring experts who work in artificial intelligence. (upbeat music) Next, the military spends $140 billion on research and development. And a reminder, I know that\nthese numbers are abstract and billion doesn't\nmean anything to anyone, but $140 billion, that's the\nentire economy of Morocco that the Pentagon spends on\nR&D, thinking about the future, with the goal of \"maintaining\ntechnological superiority on the battlefield.\" Meaning they're working on new tech. It's a huge part of\nwhat the Pentagon does. Now, a lot of this stuff is classified, but we do know that the\nPentagon is spending money on stuff like AI, using AI\nto analyze drone footage, to improve their targeting capabilities, building autonomous submarines or these insane military\nlasers that they use at sea to attack other ships. For years, they've also\nbeen trying to develop this exoskeleton that will supercharge the abilities of their soldiers, allow them to carry more weight\nover long periods of time. Although this technology,\nwhile potentially promising, isn't really there yet. But it might be soon. Now, the Pentagon pours\na lot of investment into these technologies\nfor the battlefield, but sometimes this tech\nactually turns into stuff that we use every day. Like GPS, drones, voice\nrecognition, the computer mouse, and the internet itself\nare all technologies that were first developed,\nat least in part, by the US military. - The worldwide web, or\nthe web, was created for and by the United States\nDepartment of Defense. (intriguing music) - Let's quickly look at this\nsmallest of the categories. Still $19 billion. But compared to all these\nother ones, it's pretty small. This is construction, building new facilities\nboth at home and abroad. Like this little project, $85 million for jet fuel tanks in Japan, supporting force\nprojection in the Pacific. Or it looks like they're\nproposing $75 million to spend on a new operations support\nfacility in southern California. (intriguing music) And finally, we get to\nthe part of the budget that you probably think about when you think of military\nspending, procurement. (thrilling music) $167 billion, the entire\neconomy of Ethiopia, to purchase all of this. (thrilling music) Okay, I've always known that\nmilitary stuff is expensive, but now I really know it. Let's look at some of this stuff. (thrilling music)\n(cannon firing) This jet cost around $142 million. The US bought 77 of them in 2023 and is asking for another $14 billion to buy 83 more this year. And they're pretty spendy to fly too. (thrilling music)\n(jet roaring) Look at these four cruise missiles parachuting out of a plane. (thrilling music) Each one of these missiles\ncosts $1.6 million. (thrilling music) Oh, and the American taxpayer\nbought 600 of them last year. (thrilling music)\n(cannon firing) This vehicle costs $372,000. It's used to move troops\naround the battlefield. Last year we bought about 3,700 of them, and this year we won another 3,100. $2.8 billion buying 24 of these F-15s. For the Navy, this is\ngoing to cost $7.3 billion, $1.2 billion for these\n56 Black Hawk helicopters for the Army, $8.2 billion for\nthree destroyer class ships. Probably doing the same\nthing with those (indistinct) is going to be by $2.2 billion. I mean, it's a lot. And these are just a\nfew tiny little samples. I'm just scratching the surface. And in fact, this diagram\nthat looks so complex and granular is also highly\nsimplified and condensed. Each one of these categories\nactually contains billions of tiny little things inside of it. (gentle music) This organization is much bigger\nthan we could ever fathom. And in fact, it's much bigger\nthan the Pentagon itself can even fathom. - The Pentagon has, up\nuntil this point in 2024, never successfully passed an audit. American taxpayers want to know how our tax dollars are getting spent, and the fact that the\ndepartment that's getting such a huge chunk of the\nfederal budget can't account for all of the dollars\nis definitely a problem. - For six years in a row now, the Pentagon has failed to\npass an independent audit. They've brought in a bunch\nof accountants and said, \"Tell us where all of our stuff is and what we spend our money on.\" And the accountants say,\n\"No, we can't do it.\" 61% of their physical assets are missing, they don't know where they are, which means they're probably\ninvesting a lot of money in stuff that they already have\nand they just don't know it. But my bigger question here is, why? The United States pulled out\nof Afghanistan a few years ago, the war in Iraq is over, but\nspending continues to go up. And spending went down\nfor like a split second. But look, it's going up again. (gentle music) Okay, well, first off, remember what we talked about earlier. The US is not a normal country\nwith a regular military. The US is the global hegemon,\nwho uses its military to assert control and order\nover every corner of the globe. But there's another reason\nwhy this budget is so high, and this reason is much\nmore infuriating to me. (intriguing music) What our little graph here\ndoesn't reveal is that most of this money is going\nto private corporations who get 466 billion of\nthese dollars, about 54%. And once again, the US\ngovernment tells us exactly which corporations they\ngive all this money to. We pulled the last 19 years worth of data on these private contractors. (intriguing music) At the top of this list, you\nstart to see the same names over and over, Raytheon,\nGeneral Dynamics, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin. These are the names at\nthe top of these lists year after year. There used to be a lot of\ndifferent defense contractors, but over the last three\ndecades, they got gobbled up by these big five. (intriguing music) \"Transitioning,\" from the\nwords of the Pentagon, \"from 51 to five aerospace\nand defense prime contractors. As a result, the DoD\nis increasingly reliant on a small number of contractors for critical defense capabilities.\" I.e., we've got kind of a\nmonopoly issue on our hands. These five contractors own the space and the Pentagon can't really go elsewhere if they need an F-35. There's only one shop\nin town that makes it. For this reason, the prices\ncan get pretty out of control. The Pentagon used to pay\n$25,000 for this Stinger missile and now they pay nearly\nhalf a million dollars for the same missile. The price went up more than 16 times in just a couple decades. It's a little more than inflation. - There's a history of defense contractors overcharging the US government. They can overcharge. If they're the only company\nproducing a certain widget, then there's no competition. And that's one of the\nproblems with monopoly, is if there's not competition, it's easy to overcharge the buyer. In addition, the Inspector General of the Department of\nDefense has found routinely that there's overcharging\nthrough corruption and waste and fraud, and there have been lawsuits. For example, KBR is a contractor\nthat's been used overseas and they were found to overcharge in dining halls by 30 to 40%. - It's also why a Pentagon\ninspector realized that the Pentagon was paying Boeing, yes, that Boeing, $3,357\nfor one ball bearing, a small little piece that the\nPentagon could actually get for $15 in their own warehouse. $15 and 42 cents, to be precise. When the Pentagon does get around to investigating these contractors, they sometimes find that\nthey're taking huge profits, like 40 to 50% profit margins, giving them hundreds\nand millions of dollars above what they should be making in any kind of typical\nbusiness environment. And what do they do\nwith all these profits? Well, they pay their executives very well. But this list also tells us what they do. (bright piano music) This is a list of how much money these defense contractors spend\nto influence our lawmakers into spending more money on the military so that these companies\ncan make more money. You can see right here\nthat Lockheed Martin is at the top of the list. So far this year in this election cycle, Lockheed Martin has spent $2.7 million split pretty evenly between\nDemocrats and Republicans. This is a number that\nwill continue to go up as we get closer to the election. And it is money spent\nto cozy up to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Contributing to their campaigns, bringing them out to show them\nhow great their weapons are, doing whatever they can to make sure that the money keeps\nflowing to their companies. (bright piano music) These companies also benefit from the infamous revolving door. (intriguing music) The revolving door is not a literal door, it's a metaphorical door\nbetween the Pentagon and the defense corporations, which allows top military\nleaders like Jim Mattis to serve in the military for\ndecades, retire as a general, and then join the board\nof General Dynamics, a defense contractor, only to pass through the proverbial door to become the Secretary\nof Defense under Trump. After which he passes\nthrough the door again to go back onto the board\nof General Dynamics, bringing with him all\nof his insider knowledge and government contacts and influence. And know this is not just Jim Mattis. This is a very normal thing\nthat people do here in DC. One analysis found that in 2022, top defense companies hired 672 employees directly out of the Pentagon\nto work as lobbyists, board members, and executives. (upbeat music) Go check my sources if you\nwant to read more about this. I mean, yes, the revolving\ndoor is metaphorical, but it's also pretty physical and literal. I drive on this freeway all the time, and I'm always struck at\nhow close all of this is. Over here is the Pentagon and over here are all\nthe defense contractors in an area of town literally\ncalled Pentagon City. - If there's someone working in government who is deciding on contracts, and they have a conversation with someone who's going\nto receive that contract, the person in the firm can\npromise a good, high-paying job after that government\nofficial is out of government. And so the government\nofficial then has an incentive to give a generous\ncontract to the contractor because they know they're getting\nthis kind of quid pro quo. They're going to get a high-paying job after they leave government. - And to add insult to injury here, some of the lawmakers who\napprove the Pentagon's budget own stocks in the defense\ncontracting companies. Like, the lawmakers get richer if we spend more money on defense. No, no, no, no. Why do we do this? This is like classic, basic, simple. No, conflict of interest.\nWe should not do this. This is not a thing we should do. But actually owning\nstocks in these companies is not the biggest way, I think, that our lawmakers are influenced\nby defense contractors. There's something more\nsubtle going on here that I think is actually\nthe best explanation. And it has to do with this excellent map. (upbeat music) This map was assembled\nby an Air Force veteran and analyst named Christian Sorensen. This map makes it easy\nto see how contractors intentionally allocate their operations all across the country, spanning dozens of states\nand political districts. Building all of this stuff\nmeans jobs, which people like. So lawmakers are incentivized\nto keep these contractors making stuff in their\ndistrict to provide jobs for their people so they\ncan keep getting elected. It's honestly brilliant. It's smart. This is political engineering. You can see it very clearly with lawmakers like Roger Wicker, a senator\nfrom the state of Mississippi. Senator Wicker is a member of the US Senate Committee\non Armed Services, which plays a huge role\nin giving taxpayer money to the Pentagon, which in turn feeds the bottom\nline of the contractors. Wicker loves the military, and you often hear him advocating that we should spend way\nmore on the military. - We need in the United States\nto spend more on defense. It's a necessity. - He writes op-eds in The New York Times calling for more shipbuilding. And when you look at\nhis state, you realize, of course he does. The largest employer in\nMississippi is this naval shipyard run by a defense contractor\nnamed Huntington Ingalls, which means more jobs\nand economic stimulus for Wicker's people in his state, which means a better\nlikelihood of being reelected. Now, these defense contractors\nknow that Senator Wicker is an important part of their bottom line, so they contribute huge amounts\nof money to his campaign to make sure he gets reelected. It's this virtuous cycle\nbetween Senator Wicker and the defense contractors that results in us spending more money on things that maybe we don't need to. Senator Wicker's job is to\nrepresent the American people. He sits on a committee that\nis supposed to be looking at our national security as a whole. And yet thanks to the strategy of these for-profit defense contractors, this lawmaker has way too\nmuch incentive to advocate for more military spending,\nwhich is exactly what he does. My issue here is less with Senator Wicker or Congressman Mike Rogers,\nwho has the same thing, sits on a committee, gives a\nbunch of money to the Pentagon, has a state where billions of dollars of defense contract money comes into, takes tons of money\nfrom defense contractors for his campaign, gets reelected, continues to approve more money\nfor the Pentagon, et cetera. My issue is with the system\nthat allows this to happen, that allows the money from our\nmilitary spending to be used to influence our lawmakers\ninto more military spending. That's so clearly a conflict of interest. (dramatic music) And it is this system that\nhas created an environment where there is very\nlittle political pushback to the endless ratcheting\nup of our military budget. - No Congressperson wants to be the person who loses jobs in their district. Nobody wants to be the one\nknown as shutting down a plant and people becoming unemployed. And so Lockheed can say, \"We\nhave to have increased funding of this contract or you will lose jobs.\" And so that idea that jobs are essential, the Department of Defense's\nspending is essential really gives the the\ncontractor political power. (soft dramatic music) (intriguing music) - Let me make one point clear, which is that this isn't\nall corporate lobbying that contributes to the US\nspending so much on the military. That would be too lazy of an explanation. We live in a world where there's\na well-documented paradox that explains that strong\nmilitaries are actually the key ingredient to avoiding conflict, in deterring an enemy from attacking, keeping a balance between big militaries so that no one attacks. Maybe someday we won't need militaries even close to the size that we have today, but it appears that in today's world, we still do need big militaries\nwith credible threats to avoid the age-old human curse of war. And yet, on the other side\nof that paradox is the fact that if you grow your military,\nyou force your adversary to do the same, to keep pace with you. The US and the Soviet Union did that for decades during the Cold War. Each ratcheting up their military\nuntil suddenly both sides had over 10,000 nuclear warheads. That is madness. It diverges from the rational. And yet it's the logical result when we decide that the main solution to beating our rivals is\nto just make more weapons. - As the US spends more, Russia, China, other\ncountries are spending more. If you look at the discretionary budget, about 50% of that goes to\nthe Department of Defense, and only one or 2% of that goes\nto the Department of State. You can see where our priorities are. A show of force is really\nthe first foreign policy of the US. - For this one, the explanation is easy. Diplomacy is hard and\ncomplicated and long. It doesn't make leaders feel as powerful and secure as having a big military does. And no one's getting rich off diplomacy. And yet diplomacy, international law, and organizations, treaties, cooperation, that is how we solve our differences. That is how we have\nlearned to live peacefully on this globe. The fact is no one ever\nachieved sustainable peace by spending more on their military. And finally, we have to remember that, while we pour so much into our military, that is money that can't\nbe spent elsewhere. - If we increase defense spending, that necessarily has to mean\nsomething else decreases. Bigger piece of the pie for defense, smaller piece of the pie for other things. And those other things\nmight be healthcare, education, climate change, and so on. And then we can also think\nof this notion of security. What actually makes us secure? Does spending more on\ndefense make us more secure? If you look at other sources of security, having good roads and bridges,\nhaving safe drinking water, these are all things that\nAmericans need investment in to be safe, to be healthy. So we're economically secure, people have jobs that they can\ngo to, funding for college, those are all sources of security as well. So it's not just military security we need to think of when we\nthink of the federal budget. - I deeply respect the men and women who work and serve the\ncountry in the military, but I think that our laws and norms around how much money\nwe give to the military prevents us from assessing\nthis situation clearly. The system we have incentivizes\nthe wrong priorities. Priorities that have a lot\nmore to do with profit margins of companies and the\nelectability of lawmakers. All of this setting us on a\npath of infinite escalation that risks ending in disaster. (intriguing music) Hey, thanks for watching, everyone.

In five days, Donald\nTrump will be sworn in as president of the United States. Thousands of miles away in Cairo, Egypt, at this bank 11 kilometers\nfrom the international airport, a bank manager receives a handwritten note from someone who holds\nan account at the bank. The note asks him to, quote, \"Kindly withdraw a sum\nof 9,998,000 US dollars.\" This was unusual. But according to bank records, bank employees did what they were told, heading to a vault full of US dollars and assembling stacks of $100\nbills into two large bags. It all weighed about 200 pounds and comprised a large part\nof all of the US dollars that were in Egypt at the time now sitting in bags in\nthe manager's office. Until later that day\nwhen four men showed up. They verified that they were\nassociated with the account and they took the money, put it into a truck, and left. The bank account where that\n$10 million was taken out of belonged to a shadowy organization called The Research and Studies Center. It was an Egyptian entity, but it's an entity that US\nIntelligence believes is a front for the general intelligence\nservices of Egypt. Basically Egypt's\ninternational spy agency, the Egyptian CIA, let's say. So the Egyptian CIA takes out $10 million. And from here, the trail goes cold. Because shortly after this\ntransfer of $10 million, the account is closed. And that entity, The\nResearch and Studies Center who owned the account,\napparently doesn't exist anymore. Why did the Egyptian CIA\nneed $10 million in cash? Who were these men who collected it? What were they doing,\nand what, if anything, does this $10 million have to do with former President Donald Trump? This is a really important\nset of questions, one that the FBI and federal lawyers have been secretly investigating\nto try to answer for years because they strongly\nsuspected that this $10 million made its way into the hands\nof the Trump campaign, a foreign country trying\nto buy the election. And in exchange, buying\nloyalty from the new president. And they suspected that Trump\nmay have known about this and accepted this bribe. And if he did, that would be\na violation of federal law. I wanna tell you this\nstory of this investigation and how it was suddenly shut down by Department of Justice officials who were appointed by Donald Trump. This recently released\nWashington Post investigation reveals that there was\nmuch, much more going on that we didn't know about until just now. So I'm gonna try to visualize this story, show it to you in the\nclearest way possible. Now listen, I know that this is a very politically sensitive topic. There's an election coming up. We all are taking our sides. I commit to you that I'm going to stick to rock solid facts here. I'm gonna lay them out the best I can and show you the evidence that clearly demonstrates\nhow we know these facts. Whenever I'm making\ncircumstantial connections or my own analysis, I will\ntry to make that very clear. Ultimately, I wanna lay this all out and let you make a decision as to whether you think\nthere was wrongdoing here, whether you think something\nneeds to be changed or someone needs to be held accountable. As always, every assertion\nin this video is fact checked and linked in my sources by time code. You can always check\nthat out, scrutinize it, leave comments if you have issues with it. And with that, let's dive in. - Today I wrote another\ncheck for $10 million. I'm spending money like crazy. President El-Sisi has been somebody that's been very close to me\nfrom the first time I met him. I met during the campaign. Where I could stand in\nthe middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody, and I\nwouldn't lose any voters, okay? - Hey, before we go on, I wanna explain something\nabout our methodology of reporting on stories like this. Going deep on stories takes weeks, like, sometimes six or eight or 10 weeks to like really understand these stories. And a tool we've been using\nmore and more is Ground News, who is the sponsor of today's video. Ground News is a website and an app that gathers news from around the world and condenses it into one single article. They'll show you this story and then they'll show\nyou who's covering it, how factual the different sources are, who those sources are owned by, and what political leaning or bent is present in the coverage. All of this happening in\none seamless experience both on mobile and desktop. Let me give you an example\nfrom this very story. If you type in the Trump\nEgypt story into Ground News, you can see that more\nthan a dozen news outlets have picked up the story and almost all of the\ncoverage is from the left. Only 13% of the coverage comes from right-leaning publications. And you can see that one\nleft-leaning source claims that democracy will die if the case against Trump is dropped. While a right-leaning\nsource downplays the event as a, quote, \"brief probe.\" I mean, there's a ton of bias present in both of these headlines, and Ground News lets you easily see that. There's also this feature\ncalled My News Bias, where you can look at your reading habits, the top sources that you're drawn to, how reliable the articles\nare that you read, and it will help flag blind\nspots in your information, the stuff that you're either avoiding consciously or unconsciously. In other words, it helps get\nyou out of your echo chamber, which, in this day and age, is becoming more and more important. So if you value critical\nthinking and unbiased news, this is probably a good tool for you. And Ground News is offering a 40% discount to people who use my link. It is GroundNews.com/JohnnyHarris.

And with that, let's\ndive back into this story about Donald Trump and Egypt. (pensive music) All right, hold on a sec. I have been using this elementary school\npenmanship practice paper for about 10 years as\nmy note taking platform. And I don't know why, but I love it. Okay. To keep things totally\nrock solid, crystal clear, I'm gonna make a list. I'm gonna call this list, What We Know. And in this box, on this list, I am going to put the\nthings that we truly know that are rock solid facts\nto keep us crystal clear. Number one, we know that\nEgypt wanted to give money to Donald Trump's campaign. They planned on it, they approved it. How do we know that? The CIA. \"Ah, Johnny Harris talking\nabout the CIA again. Here we go.\" The CIA spies on everyone. We know that. We know they spy on foreign\ncountries and foreign leaders. And during the 2016 presidential campaign, we know that they had a\nconfidential informant within the Egyptian government. This was a reliable informant who had given the CIA reliable\ninformation in the past. They trusted this person. Between this informant and,\nquote, \"other operations,\" the CIA learned that,\nquote, \"Egyptian leaders, including Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, had signed off on sending $10 million to Mr. Trump's cash-trapped campaign.\" They say this happened just\nbefore the 2016 election. Okay, let's go back to our list here and make this more specific. The CIA is actually saying that they know that the\npresident of Egypt, El-Sisi, actually signed off on giving\nDonald Trump $10 million, specifically $10 million. We were never supposed to learn about this intel, by the way. This was totally classified,\npart of a secret investigation. And in my mind this\nintel is quite reliable. It comes from multiple sources, it comes from a reliable informant. And the CIA used it as a way to pass along to the Department\nof Justice their concern that there may have been some foreign interference from Egypt. And with that, let's get back to this guy, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi,\nthe president of Egypt. He's a military man who\nrose to power in 2014 after kicking out Egypt's first\ndemocratically-elected president, who by the way was horribly unpopular and the people also kind\nof wanted to kick him out. But, yeah, he rose the power in a coup and then just held on to power. And predictably, once\nhe consolidated power, he started silencing the press, squashing political dissent or political opponents, locking people up, arresting journalists and\nactivists, et cetera, et cetera. Same old story. But his record was so bad that during the Obama administration, the US cut Egypt off of billions\nof dollars of military aid that we usually send them. We cut it off to basically punish El-Sisi for all of these horrible\nhuman rights abuses. So Egypt gets cut off from\nall this vital military aid. But not for long. (pensive music) Okay, here's the second thing we know. Trump and El-Sisi met up in\nNew York during the campaign, like when he was still a candidate. It was September, 2016, a few\nweeks before the election. They're at the UN headquarters. (crowd cheering) And they have this closed door meeting. And according to the Trump campaign, Trump was very warm to El-Sisi. Now remember, the US was\nkeeping Egypt at arms length because of all these human rights abuses. So, like, that was the MO for diplomats. Trump totally breaks from all of that in true Trump fashion. Says that he loves El-Sisi, he's gonna invite him to the White House. The campaign says that the US will be, quote, \"a loyal friend to Egypt.\" Here he is on Fox News\nright after the meeting. - [Donald] He's a fantastic guy. He took control of Egypt and I thought it was a great meeting. We met for a long time, actually. We had a long meeting. - So that's the other thing we know. That's why it's on this list. Trump loves El-Sisi, they have a good chemistry. Trump wants to help Egypt. So it's actually not surprising that Egypt wants to help Trump win. Like, this would be very good for El-Sisi, which explains point number one here. El-Sisi signed off on this plan\nto give $10 million to Trump according to good CIA intelligence because he wanted him to win. It would benefit him and\nhis regime if Trump won. (pensive music) Now, a little context here, presidential campaigns are really messy and hard in the last few weeks. Campaigns kind of have to spend millions and millions of dollars\nin like the last two weeks leading up to the election to blitz on advertising, on travel, on like get out the vote campaigns. But the Trump campaign found\nitself in a tricky situation in the weeks leading up\nto the 2016 election. They didn't have the money to do this. They were running out. So what did the campaign do? They asked Trump himself for money. This post investigation reveals\nthat they pleaded with Trump to write a check to his campaign for a final blitz of television ads. And the response was, no. \"Trump repeatedly declined.\" He didn't wanna give any\nmore of his own money to this campaign. That is until October 28th, 2016. It's five weeks after Trump\nand El-Sisi met in New York, and Trump suddenly changes his mind and announces that he's\ngoing to write a check to his campaign for this final blitz. And how much is he going to give? $10 million. - [Donald] Today I wrote\nanother check for $10 million. I'm spending money like crazy.\n(crowd cheering) - Now, one small thing here,\nTrump advisors told the FBI that while this $10 million\nlooked like a contribution, like a donation from\nTrump to his campaign, they actually structured it as a loan. $10 million that could\nbe paid back to Trump. Okay, so we know that\nPresident El-Sisi signed off on giving Trump's campaign $10 million. Why? Because Trump and El-Sisi are friends and a Trump presidency would benefit El-Sisi and his regime greatly. We also know that Trump who refused to give money to his campaign in the final weeks\nleading up to the election suddenly changed his mind and wrote a check for $10\nmillion to his campaign, which was a loan to be paid back. Okay, I'm gonna add that to the list. Does this all feel solid to everyone? Like, we're... Like, these are rock\nsolid facts in my mind. And now let's just add the point that we talked about\nat the very beginning, that five days before\nTrump was inaugurated, $10 million of cash... Or sorry, $9,998,000, two grand away from $10 million, was loaded up in two bags\nin cash and carted away, taken out of a bank account that is associated with\nEl-Sisi's intelligence agency. I'm gonna add this to the list. So looking at these four items, doesn't it kind of feel obvious? Doesn't your brain want\nto connect the dots and paint a picture that it\nfeels very clear in my brain? President, El-Sisi, who we\nknow wants to give $10 million to his new friend Donald Trump orders $10 million to\nbe taken out of a bank and secretly transferred\nto Trump's campaign. And Trump knowing this\nsuddenly feels comfortable loaning his campaign exactly $10 million, knowing that he'd be repaid\nfrom this money from Egypt. Doesn't it all lined up? Like, case closed. We can just like convict somebody. No, that's not how it works. That's not how the burden of proof works. It's not how our justice system works. This list, while full of robust facts, still doesn't paint a\npicture of any wrongdoing. It is in the realm of\ncircumstantial evidence. $10 million over here,\n$10 million over here, they must connect. But investigators never\nfound the connection. They never found the $10 million flowing in to Trump's bank account. And therefore, this is\ncircumstantial evidence and not rock solid provable anything. But luckily, when we have this, that's what investigations are for. (gentle percussive music) Soon after Trump takes office, the Department of Justice\nlaunches an investigation. Because remember, this is when\nthe CIA told them that quote, \"El-Sisi signed off on\ngiving Trump $10 million.\" This was concerning intel and\nit was happening at a time, if you remember, that\nthere was a lot of concern about foreign interference\nin American democracy. A lot of that focused on Russia. That was public, that was a big thing. We all talked about Russia\nforeign interference. But at the same time, there was this investigation happening into whether Egypt helped\nbuy the 2016 election. It was all happening\nquietly in the background because it was pretty sensitive. We're talking about potential bribery of a sitting president. So the FBI and investigators\nare looking into this, trying to find evidence\nof potential wrongdoing. Meanwhile, president Trump\ntakes office and starts to do exactly what he kind\nof promised he would do when it came to Egypt. He invites El-Sisi as\none of the first guests to the White House. He calls him, and this is a direct quote from someone who was in the\nroom at the G7 Summit in France. Quote, \"My favorite dictator.\" God, Trump. Boy. \"My favorite dictator.\" And then remember how\nEgypt had been cut off by the Obama administration of like $1.4 billion of military aid? Trump unfreezes that money and it starts to flow to El-Sisi, not for anything in return, just give El-Sisi the money. And this was against the advice of his first secretary of state. He said like, \"This is not a good idea.\" And Trump's like, \"Yes, it is.\" $1.4 billion to Egypt. Now listen, if, big word, \"if.\" Put if on the screen. If El-Sisi had bribed\nTrump with $10 million to help get him elected, then\nhis investment is paying off. He is benefiting a ton\nfrom a Trump presidency. Now, we don't know if he did. We don't have any direct\nevidence that he did. But if he did, pretty good investment. So while this is all happening, the FBI and federal investigators continue to try to find a link. $10 million leaving Egypt. Did it ever enter Donald\nTrump's bank account somehow? To find this out, they\ntook the investigatory step of requesting Donald Trump's\npersonal bank records. They were gonna look at them\nto find large transactions to see if $10 million showed up sometime before the election. So let's get a calendar out here. The FBI requested records\nspanning May to November, 2016, the months leading up to the election. But guess what? They didn't find anything. They found no suspicious deposits from foreign entities of $10 million. So then they decided to go\nlook at the Egyptian bank and get their records and they fought in this\nmassive battle that is wild, and it's detailed in\nThe Post investigation because the Egyptian bank didn't want to give over their records. They're like, \"No, no, no, no, no. We're not gonna give over our records because that would,\" quote, \"wreak havoc on American foreign policy, possibly alienating US allies, undermining diplomatic efforts, and inviting reciprocal treatment.\" Geez, what's in these\nrecords, Egyptian bank? Like, what is in these records that's gonna topple\nAmerican foreign policy? So this epic court battle goes down, there's like a secret investigation and court thing happening in DC. It goes all the way to the Supreme Court. And finally, the Egyptian bank has to surrender the records. And this is how we learn about the big transfer in US dollars that happened from the\nEgyptian bank in cash. They didn't know about this before. But the investigators\nnotice something weird about all of these records that they got from the Egyptian bank, which is that other than\nthat tiny handwritten note that said, \"Put $10 million in two bags and four guys are gonna come pick it up,\" they felt like something was missing. And I'm gonna quote\ndirectly from The Post here, just so clear. They found that the bank, quote, \"had not turned over a single email of that enormous same day transaction,\" the $10 million of cash, and \"that the lack of any\ninternal communication on such a huge sum of money, same day transaction, was unthinkable.\" The US prosecutor who\nwas heading this case continues with, \"Its strains credulity that the bank kept such a\nstockpile of US dollars on hand, let alone that it was\nable to be gathered up in less than 24 hours.\" Translation, the bank\nprobably didn't give over all their records. Like, really, there was no\nother like emails being like, \"Hey, there's gonna be a\n$10 million transaction from this bank branch near the airport.\" So they're probably missing some records, but they did get that handwritten note that talked about the $10\nmillion transfer in cash five days before the inauguration. January 15th, let's get\nback to the calendar. Now, remember, the FBI had\naccess to Trump's bank records from May to November, 2016. So if the $10 million was\ngoing to the Trump campaign, the FBI wouldn't see it because they only had Trump's\nrecords up to November, 2016. \"Okay, well, that's easy,\" says the FBI. \"Now that we have new information about this $10 million\ntransfer from Egypt, let's just get a wider set of records from Trump's bank, something after January 15th so that we can see if\nsome $10 million deposit shows up there.\" This is like standard\ninvestigatory procedure. One FBI agent told The Post that if this were any other investigation, they would have a justification to get these records,\nquote, \"in a heartbeat.\" But because this wasn't\nany other investigation, this was investigating the\nfinances of a sitting president, they would have to ask\ntheir boss for permission. And who is their boss? This guy, Bill Barr. And here's where the investigation starts to deteriorate, unfortunately. (pensive music) Bill Barr was appointed by Donald Trump to be the Attorney General. That's the head of the\nDepartment of Justice, the top law enforcer of America. Bill Barr can reasonably\nbe considered a Trump ally. You may disagree with me on this. And if you do, please\nsay so in the comments. I'd love to hear your rebuttal\nto what I'm about to say. His job is to keep the\npresident legal and honest. And yet, what he showed during his tenure is that he would often side with Trump. He would undermine\ninvestigations against him and he even stoked fears\nof voter fraud in 2020 without real evidence. Though he did eventually come out and affirm that the 2020\nelection was not stolen because there's no evidence that it was. But, yeah, the guy is a Trump ally. And the big question is, why does the president\nget to appoint the person who is supposed to keep\nhim legal and honest? The American system is not perfect and there's also other\nspecial sort of controls on how we keep the president honest, even if this guy's biased\nand politically motivated. Anyway, I'm not gonna go into that. That's a story for another day. The point is, Bill Barr,\nwe can say is a Trump ally and he is the boss of all these people who are investigating the\nTrump-Egypt connection. So he hears about this investigation, he hears that the agents want to expand the amount of bank records\nthat they can get on Trump so that they can see if there\nwas a $10 million deposit after the cash left Egypt. And he doesn't like it. He doesn't like it one bit. He goes to the FBI director and he says, \"Hey, you need to,\" quote, \"impose adult supervision on\nthese agents who are,\" quote, \"hell bent on getting a wider range of Trump's records.\" Adult supervision. Yikes. That doesn't sound good. Barr starts voicing doubt\nabout the actual agents who are working on this investigation and starts to question whether or not there's\neven enough evidence to continue the investigation. Now, a note about the agents. If Bill Barr is politically appointed and potentially marred by political bias, the investigators in\nthis case often are not. They're career employees\nof the department. They are there because\nthey are good at their job. They have shown that they're committed to the values of justice in America. They've not risen because\nthey have garnered favor with some political person, at least not as much as\npolitical appointees. Politics is in everything. It's impossible to escape it. But these career investigators\nhave different incentives. And these career\ninvestigators felt strongly that this investigation\nneeded to continue. That they had evidence\nthat the next logical step was to get a wider\nrange of Trump's records so they could see if\nthis $10 million shows up and they are met with\nmore and more resistance by Barr and other Trump appointed leaders within the Department of Justice. This drama, this tension, which\nwas all happening in secret, is now thoroughly documented in this Washington Post investigation. I recommend that you read it because the The Post interviewed like dozens of these people\nwho were in the room, and it paints a picture\nthat is very clear. The political appointees\ndidn't want this to happen. It all comes to an end when Barr kind of suddenly\nreplaces the prosecutor who was working on this case with someone who was\nmore aligned with him. And he almost immediately pumps the brakes on this investigation. He halts it. A few months later, BARR\nreplaces that person with a new prosecutor who\nthen sends out an email with the subject line\n\"Egypt Investigation.\" The Post looked at this\nemail, verified it, and it states that, quote, \"Based on review of this\ninvestigation, we would be,\" quote, \"closing the above matter with\nno conviction or indictment.\" So it was over. That was it. Whether or not that $10 million from Cairo ended up in Trump's world and whether or not Trump knew that that $10 million was coming, and therefore he gave $10 million to his campaign knowing\nhe would get paid back, whether Trump's actions as president, actions that greatly benefited Egypt were the result of this money\ninfluencing his decisions, we will probably never know any of this. And in the eyes of the career\nprosecutors working on this, because the mechanism\nthrough which we know things, investigation was shut down too early and through politically motivated bias. Now, that's my read. I'm gonna make it very clear. That's my read on this. You should read the accounts\nof these prosecutors who felt like it was shut down too early. My read, my connection is that\nit was done by a Trump ally for politically motivated reasons. And so all we're left with is this, a list of some rock solid\nfacts that look pretty fishy, but nonetheless are not rock\nsolid evidence of wrongdoing. In 2021, a new administration\ncame into the White House. They could have reopened\nthis investigation and seen it through properly. And yet, the new Attorney\nGeneral wasn't briefed on this until a year later. But by then, it had been\nmore than five years since those two bags of cash were filled with $10 million in Cairo, meaning, this thing called\nthe statute of limitations had expired. It was too late. They couldn't actually prosecute this. The Post reached out\nto the Trump campaign. And in reply, they said, quote, \"The Washington Post is\nconsistently played for suckers by deep state Trump-haters\nand bad faith actors peddling hoaxes and shams.\" Okay. And then just recently,\nin September, 2023, New Jersey Democratic\nSenator, Bob Menendez, was charged in a case that alleges that he used\nhis political influence to benefit Egypt in exchange for cash, gold bars, and other luxury items. - [Reporter] He accepted\nthese gifts from businessmen acting on behalf of the\nEgyptian government. - He was bribed by Egypt. Like, we know Egypt does this. I mean, we could add this\nto the circumstantial list. Egypt likes to bribe people. Okay, to end this, I just\nwanna make it crystal clear, like, crystal, crystal\nclear that I am not saying that Donald Trump or\nanyone in his campaign should be convicted or found guilty for a crime in this case. It is so tempting to\nconnect all the dots here and just say like, \"Well, yeah, clearly,\nhe did something wrong. It all adds up.\" But we just can't. That is not how justice works. Trump must be presumed innocent until there's sufficient\nevidence to prove otherwise. But to me, there's still\nsomething condemnable here, which is that a group\nof political appointees were able to shut down an investigation that career prosecutors\nsaid should not be shut down because there were further\ninvestigatory steps to take, rational reasonable steps that they would've\ntaken on any other case. But in this case, they couldn't. That's the travesty here. To me, that's not\njustice, that's politics. So with that, I wanna leave you\nwith a strong recommendation to read the full investigation\nfrom the Washington Post. There's more detail in there that sheds light on how this went down. And I'm grateful for the reporters who spent the months and\nmonths uncovering this because it brings it to light. Maybe if we see this and\nunderstand it and talk about it, it'll be less likely to happen again. Thanks for watching, folks. See you the next one. - [Donald] He's a fantastic guy. Took control of Egypt and got along. There was a good chemistry there. You know when you have\ngood chemistry with people. You're (indistinct) of that. And there was a very good chemistry, good feeling between us. And I really enjoyed that meeting. It was the other day. And he's done a very good job and we had a very respectful meeting.

I wanna look at the bigger\nreasons why we're all so tired. A lot of those reasons have to do with what's happening\nright now during the day. Like right now, while I'm filming this, things are happening in my brain and your brain that will make\nus more tired later on today and tomorrow. It'll affect how long\nand how well you sleep and whether or not you feel\nrefreshed in the morning. (soft music) In order to understand\nwhy you're so tired, I'm gonna take you back in\ntime to 300,000 years ago. (clock ticking) Meet Johnny Caveman. Johnny Caveman kind of has a\nsimilar body to ours today. He's a human. His body's\na little different. His hips and his head are\nshaped a little differently. He's got this wider, flatter nose. He's got this big, strong\nbrow, but up where it counts, his brain is very similar\nto our brain today, and yet how he uses his\nbrain is very different, similar brains, totally different worlds. To show this, let me show you Johnny\nCaveman's morning routine. (bright music) As Johnny Caveman begins his day, let's keep an eye on\nthis part of his brain. This is the prefrontal cortex. When you make decisions, this part of your brain\nis doing most of the work. This morning, Johnny Caveman\nhas a few decisions to make. He has to decide where\nto get his water today. Should he go out and hunt with his group or should he spend time picking berries? He just found some mushrooms.\nAre these mushrooms safe? Should he eat them? Johnny Caveman will likely\nspend a big chunk of his day just sitting here around\nthis campsite eating and chatting with his\nband of other humans. He might go out and gather\nsticks to build a campfire later. I mean, look at his brain. There's some decisions being made here, but it isn't pinging very much. There's not a ton of action up here in the prefrontal cortex. His day is routine with\nnot a ton of choices, fairly simple decisions, okay, but let's transport forward in time now. I wonder what would happen if we put this same Johnny\nCaveman in the 20th century. Same brain, same body, different world. (bright music) Ah, yawn. The sun is still waking Johnny Caveman up and now he's got a few decisions to make. He decides to shave\nbefore he goes to work. What's for breakfast? Apples again? I think I'll have a peach. Now off to work. The world's gone through\nthe industrial revolution, so he spends his day at a factory where he's repeating tasks over and over. He's definitely making more decisions than Johnny Caveman was. But the prefrontal cortex\nisn't pinging a ton. It's not a lot of action up here. Okay, how does Johnny Caveman do in 2024? - [Brain] Did I get\nenough sleep last night? Where's my phone? Is my kid's concert today or tomorrow? Oh, I need new socks. These don't match. What should I eat for lunch later? Should I cancel with my coworker? Did I have a burrito yesterday? I need to remember to send the receipts to the insurance company. I need to file that expense report. What am I gonna change to this fish? How much gas is in my car? Should I get a oil change this week? Should I be upgrading to a different? It's 8:30 in the morning and I've already made a ton of decisions, way more than Johnny Caveman or the Johnny from the 20th century. These decisions are complex. They are abstract, they're high stakes. My prefrontal cortex is going bananas. One estimate I read said that modern humans make\n35,000 decisions every day. We make more than 200\ndecisions about food alone. Okay, okay, I get it. Modern life is full of a lot of decisions, but like, I'm not running\nfrom tigers anymore. Like I don't have to like\nscavenge and hunt for my food. Shouldn't I be less tired? I'm using my brain instead of my body and I'm doing way less physical work. I mean, we've got washing\nmachines and dishwashers and automatic head\nmassagers and at-home spas, and damn it, we even have La-Z-Boys. Shouldn't I feel more rested\nbecause of all of this? Okay, and here's where\nwe come to the answer to the question, which is we gotta look at that prefrontal cortex again and see what's actually going on when you make all of these decisions. It's a part of a war that is happening between\nyou and the modern world. This war is being fought on\ntwo different battlefields, daytime and nighttime. ♪ Day man ♪ ♪ Aha ♪ ♪ Fighter of the night man ♪ ♪ Aha ♪ ♪ Champion of the sun ♪ So we're in this daytime battlefield and you're making a bunch of decisions. We've talked about that. Let's see what's happening\nhere in the brain. When you're making decisions, there's an electronic\nsignal, like a pulse, that is traveling between\nregions of the brain along these wires called neurons. You've got like almost a\nhundred billion of these things and they all are forming\nthis giant network, tons of connections, and they all send signals to each other. That is what decisions and actions are. But in order to send these signals between the different parts of the brain, you need a very important\nchemical called glutamate. Glutamate makes all of this happen. It's a neurotransmitter. It helps everything talk to each other. But look, after you make the decision, the glutamate kind of sticks around, and as you make more and more decisions, glutamate starts to build up and it starts to clog the system, which new research suggests\nmakes decisions harder because the whole system is clogged, which makes you feel fatigued. Make a bunch of decisions, you feel tired even if\nyou didn't lift a finger. It's like as if your\nbrain were a big city. All of these roads are the neurons and synapses that you\nuse to make decisions. It's all functioning nicely. Everyone can flow, but the more decisions you\nmake, the more trash you produce and the trash starts to pile up. Trash collectors will\neventually move this trash out, but if you're producing a ton\nof trash, it starts to pile up and it eventually starts to block the streets making it much harder for the cars to move along. Meaning for your brain activity to do what it's supposed to do\nfor you to make decisions. This is what it looks like\nwhen you're really tired. It's 11:30 AM here at my desk and I've made so many decisions. I haven't done any strenuous work, but I'm drowning in\nglutamate and feeling tired. By the way, this is\nlike brand new research from the Paris Brain Institute and it is still being worked out how this works or exactly\nwhat it looks like. You can check my sources to fact check everything\nI say in this video, but look at this paper specifically, it's pretty interesting. So I'm gonna jot this down on\nmy list of why we're so tired. I'll be making this list and this solutions on\nwhat we can do about it. A lot of cultures have a solve for this. It's called biphasic sleep, which is just a cool sounding name for a nap in the afternoon. People usually around like\nthe Mediterranean take naps from the hours of like two to five. They rest, they reset. Research found that\npeople who take siestas have increased brain functioning\nand are 37% less likely to die of heart disease. But here in the United States, we pledge to not sleep on the job. We will never take naps like those failing socialist\ncountries in the Mediterranean. No, the hustle never\nstops here in America. Sorry, I recently watched Top Gun. I'm just feeling really\npatriotic right now. - That's right. I am dangerous. - So our brains, which are the same as Johnny Caveman's brains, aren't totally set up to\nmake all of these decisions without feeling very tired. I mean, it kind of makes sense. We've got these caveman\nbrains living in 2024. This is called evolutionary mismatch. Our brains haven't caught\nup with our lifestyle, with our world and all of the\ndecisions that we are required to make to just be normal, modern humans. So what do we do about this? (pensive music) Well, you can take siestas, which is like, it's not something I can do in my life. I'm just not set up for\nit here, sorry guys. But that would be a way to clear out some glutamate and reset. But the biggest takeaway\nfor me is just limit how many decisions I\nhave to make every day, which is not easy, but there\ndefinitely are ways to do it. I've started choosing the\noutfits that I'm gonna wear for the week on Sunday so that in the morning when\nI wake up, I'm just like, oh, the outfit's already chosen. Or you could go full Steve\nJobs, Mark Zuckerberg style and just wear one thing so\nthat you can have a closet that looks like this, which. Meal planning, that's another one. On a Sunday, we've started\nlike writing down every meal we're gonna have during the week, and that makes life way easier when you're at the end of a day of work and you are feeling tired. (pensive music) A big theme in today's\nvideo is information. How much information our\nbrain are met with these days. And even as a journalist, it's my job and I get stressed out by the amount of information out there. One of the tools we\nuse to sift through all of this is actually the\nsponsor of today's video, Ground News is a website and an app that takes news\nstories from all around the world and aggregates them into one place and then gives you a ton of\ninformation about that story and its sources. Instead of an algorithm, you are in control with Ground News. This tool allows you to see what political bias exists\nin the different articles, how reliable each source is, who owns these different\npublications, a whole other level of transparency that allows you to feel confident in\nthe news you're reading. One of my favorite parts about\nGround News is it helps you keep an eye on your own reading habits. It gives you this dashboard where it shows you some\ninsights, like the top sources that you rely on and\nhow reliable they are. And my favorite of these\ninsights, the Blindspot Feed. When you're navigating so\nmuch information, it's hard to remember that sometimes you are in a very different news\nbubble than everyone else. The BlinsSpot Feed helps you see this by giving you articles that\nyou wouldn't naturally click on or be exposed to helping you\nfill in your perspective, challenge your biases. I value this kind of thing\nso much as a critical thinker and as someone who is\nworried about echo chambers and bias in today's news landscape. So if you are tired of\nletting social media companies and sensational headlines\ndecide what you click, Ground News might be for you. It's a great way to sharpen\nyour critical thinking skills and to stay informed while doing it.

This will allow you to get\n40% off the Vantage Plan, which is all of these tools\nI've talked about today. So thank you Ground News for\nsponsoring today's video. With that, let's dive back\nin to why we are so tired. There's one more chemical\nwe have to talk about for this daytime battle\nand it's called adenosine. It is this very clever\nevolutionary feature of our brain. It's basically like a\nsignal to our brains. It tells us when it's time to rest. As you go throughout your day thinking and doing things, this adenosine builds up and it kind of signals to\nyour brain that you're tired. It signals that you should feel sleepy and hopefully makes you go to sleep. But being industrious\nhumans focused on progress, we found a substance that will block the buildup of adenosine. It's called caffeine, making caffeine the most\npopular drug in the world. It blocks adenosine, this natural signal of you should be tired and sleep and allows us to keep operating as if the adenosine doesn't exist. But guess what? The caffeine\ndoesn't last forever. It eventually wears out and all of this adenosine that had built up comes\nflooding into your brain like a megaphone saying,\nhey, you're really tired and we're finally able to tell you. This is called the afternoon crash. My solution to this is like\nthe greatest thing in the world and it's called a coffee nap. When you nap, your body\ngets rid of the adenosine. It's like the adenosine clearing hour, and if you drink caffeine, then you get this like multiplier effect where all the adenosine is gone and the caffeine just comes in. It doesn't have to block any adenosine and it's just ready to like hype you up. Drink a quick coffee, lay down for just 15 minutes, it's amazing. Coffee naps, add it to the list. The other option is to drink\nyour coffee a little bit like later than you would. Like don't drink it right as you wake up. Drink it between the hours of nine and 11:00 AM so that it lasts\nuntil you're done with work and then you can have your coffee crash. Okay, so that is our daytime battle. Glutamate builds up because\nwe make so many decisions. Adenosine builds up because\nwe don't let it clear out and we block the signals\nbecause of caffeine, and our modern world doesn't like us naturally clearing these things out, so we feel really tired. Now let's get to the nighttime battle. (soft music) Everyone says we should get\nseven or eight hours of sleep, but when you go to bed and when I go to bed\nis probably different. Back in the Johnny Caveman days, groups of humans couldn't leave their\ncamp unattended at night. So we evolved to have different\nsleep times so that some of us could stay awake and guard the camp and others could sleep and\nthen we could switch off. Today, what that looks like\nis that I go to bed at 10:30 and I wake up at 6:30. You may be a night owl and you want to go to bed\nat one in the morning, or you may want to go to bed at 9:00 AM. These are called the chronotypes and there are roughly four of them. Everyone has a slightly\ndifferent interpretation of what it means, but the fact is, we're not all the same when it comes to when we go to bed, and yet we all live in a society that wants us to be the same. Our standard workday, nine\nto five, was constructed for like the average person,\nbut you may not be that person. You have a job that requires\nyou to be there at 9:00 AM and you are a night owl who\nwants to sleep until 10:30? Too bad. Capitalism says no. Researchers say that our\nchronotype is in our genes. Like this is like, we are naturally coded to have an optimal time\nwhen we are sleeping, and that may not work with your life. Evolutionary mismatch once again. So I'm gonna write\nchronotypes down on my list. What's the solution here? Find\nout what your chronotype is. You probably already know what it is. Take this test online. I'll give you a QR code\nhere. You can scan this. Take a test. Maybe aligning your lifestyle\nwith your chronotype could help you get sleep during the time when your sleep is most optimal, which will help make you feel less tired. (soft music) Okay, finally, in a video that you clicked on about\nwhy you're so tired, finally, we're talking about sleep. Sleep definitely matters, and I think there's actually\na lot of great videos and literature, books, whatever on sleep and how to optimize sleep. Our brains catalog all these memories, all the sensory input and memories from the day get cataloged. Our muscles and our circulatory\nsystem, they all get to relax and take a break,\nwhich is super vital. And as we talked about\nearlier, we clear out a lot of like the byproducts from\nliving life, the glutamate, the adenosine, all of the kind of toxins and byproducts that we\naccumulate from a day. This is all super important, but not all sleep is created equal, and what we do in the hours leading up to bed can make a big difference. So let's see what this\nlooks like using an example. As we're following along,\nlet's track my chemical levels. I get home around 8:00 PM. I whip up some of my\nfamous macaroni and cheese before sitting down to my desk because I've got a little more work to do. Now my chronotype is the lion, which means I kind of want\nto go to bed like at 10. I'm getting kind of tired, so\nI pour myself a cup of coffee to fight off all the adenosine that has been building up in my brain. Okay, I finish up my work. It's two hours past when\nI'd normally go to bed, but I need some time to wind down. Here I am making more decisions on Netflix and look, even though\nit's nighttime outside, this giant TV screen is emitting light. My brain thinks this is the\nsun. It thinks it's daytime. So it blocks the release of melatonin. Melatonin's a chemical that we need to shift our brain from\nwakefulness to sleep. Finally, after some Netflix,\nI feel like I've wound down and I'm gonna go to bed. It's 2:00 AM. I turn off the TV and I get\na little bit of melatonin, but not nearly enough to feel tired. I've got a ton of adenosine in my brain, but it's not registering. I should be feeling tired, but all of this adenosine is blocked by the caffeine I had earlier. One more look at my phone to set my alarm. Gotta check Instagram really quick. Eventually the caffeine wears off. The adenosine comes flooding\nin and I fall right asleep, but it's now 3:00 AM. My body goes through the important process of clearing out all these chemicals. It's a slow process. I need time to do this. My body's making great progress and then. (alarm rings) It's been five hours, which is just not enough\ntime for our bodies to take out all the trash. My brain still kinda looks like this. I'm gonna start my day with all of the residual glutamate\nchemicals swirling around in my brain as I\nstart to make new decisions and accumulate more\nglutamate, more adenosine that I'm gonna block with caffeine. So I guess I'm gonna add\nthe obvious one to my list. Get enough sleep and wind down without caffeine or alcohol, the things that kind of kill your ability to get good sleep. Now let me just say there's\na lot more to say on sleep. It's very well documented. There's a lot of like pop\nscience books about sleep. I didn't want to go into those now because I feel like\nthey're easily accessible, but you should definitely\ncheck out my sources if you want to learn more\nabout preparing for good sleep and having good sleep and why it matters. (bright music) So this is my list. Here it is. Why we're so tired and\nwhat we can do about it. It's not exhaustive. (bell dinging) But it includes the lesser covered aspects of fatigue that I have\nfound very compelling and that have affected how I\napproach my day-to-day life. In short, it's not just\nbecause we look at our phones before bed that we're so tired,\nthere's a lot more going on, and a lot of it has to\ndo with life, modern life and these brains that we\nhave that were evolved for a very different time. There's a lot of upside to the fact that we don't live in caves next to campfires hunting for our food. But one of the downsides is that we feel this very\nspecific kind of fatigue. It's often mental fatigue, and now I understand why. I'm not gonna dramatically change my life because of these findings, but I now at least have\na list of a few things that I can tweak to maybe\nfeel a little less tired. Hey everyone, thanks for watching. I had a question for\nanyone still watching. Would you be interested in\nbuying some of my old maps? I've got like hundreds of maps that I've collected over the years and I am thinking about\nopening a map store. I could scan them and sell\nprints on really nice paper or I could sell you the\noriginals or I could do both. Let me know what you think. This is like an early\nidea and I'm just curious. I wanna hear from you all. Most people have left by now,\nand so it's just a few of you. So just like leave a comment\nif you have heard this and let me know. I also wanted to make sure that everyone knows about our new channel called Search Party, not so new. It's about a year old now, but it is started by my\nold colleague, Sam Ellis. It is a focus on geopolitics\nand global sports. It's a fantastic channel,\nvery concise, beautiful videos that I learned a lot from, and\nyou should go check it out. Thanks so much for watching.\nI'll see you in the next one. (upbeat music)"}]}

It's over 1,000 kilometers long. And it separates Finland\nfrom its neighbor, a country with 26 times\nthe population of Finland. Finland also borders the Baltic Sea where NATO has been clashing on the water with Russia's shadow fleet of ships. It's also squarely in the Arctic region, another newly vital geopolitical domain. This is a place where\nempires have clashed, and where they might clash again. (tense music) Here's the gate to Russia,\nand it is totally closed. Let's see if I can get in. I'm in Finland to train with their army as they show their new NATO allies how to fight in the high north. I'm here to sleep in the snow, to witness and participate in the rigor of Arctic warfare. But I'm also here to\ngo beyond the military to get a closer look\nat this unique country, to understand how their past haunts them, and how these memories\nhave caused this quiet and peaceful people to\nbe constantly preparing for crisis and war, a vigilance\nand awareness of threat, that might actually explain\nwhy they're considered the happiest people on Earth,\nnow, eight years in a row. From the border with Russia, to the many bunkers scattered\nthroughout the country, you're about to see a pretty\nunique security situation. A strategy, and a mindset borne out of Finland's unique geography. (tense music) So I'm headed to a military base in the frozen north of the country to join over 1,000 troops in a live combat exercise in the snow. This will be the beginning of my quest to understand how this\ncountry is preparing, and what they're preparing for. (upbeat music) - [Interviewee] Of course, there is cold, and then there is Arctic. You have to be sure that the trooper is able to survive in these circumstances. (tense music) (gentle music) - Good. I'm Felix.\n- Hey, Felix, Johnny? - Yes, nice to meet you. This is Felix. He's a captain in the Finnish Army who is a skilled outdoorsman. He has a Master's degree\nin Arctic warfare. - And I know you like maps. - (chuckles) Yes, I do.\nOh, wow, what a treat! Military maps. Wow, this is awesome. (gentle music) Felix will soon be dropping me off in the middle of the snowy forest to fight and sleep with\nthe troops in the snow. But first, there's a few important steps. First up, clothing. Here in Northern Finland, the temperatures can get\nbelow negative 40 Celsius. The cold can be as deadly\nas any artillery cannon, if not more. So this huge warehouse is\ndedicated to proper clothing. (upbeat music)\n(speaking foreign language) - You have to sign this. - Large or medium? - [Johnny] Oh, I think\nmedium, probably medium. 44? Yeah. This is all right here... This is like body armor, pad, rucksack. Everything in this big orange bag is soon gonna be on my\nbody, one way or another. 30 or 40 pounds. Time to get dressed. And even though I thought I\nknew how to put on clothes, I quickly get schooled\non how this all works. Does this go first? - [Helper] No. The mesh shirt. - Okay, cool. - [Helper] So it's all\nabout layers, basically. Did you get socks?\n- I did, yeah. - [Helper 1] Yeah.\n- [Helper 2] Yeah. - [Helper 1] Yup. - On this, and then.\n- Ah, yeah okay. - Yeah. - First this.\n- First, and then this. - [Helper 1] Yes, yeah. - So the whole concept of this is like having layers on you. Don't put the snow camo now.\n- No, not them! - Next layer, on top of those. (clothes shuffling)\n(zippers squeaking) - Wow, that's a lot of gear. Go see what it's like\nto be an arctic warrior. (soldiers faintly marching)\n(gentle music) Next we wander through the base headed towards the mess hall. We grab lunch, which for\nme is just an opportunity to ask nonstop questions to Felix who wrote his master's thesis on the future of arctic warfare. And while he said he\ncan't share it with me because it's classified, I'm still peppering him with loads of questions about what arctic warfare is. Wandering throughout the base, I also get to catch up\nwith the military leaders who direct this group of a\nfew thousand Arctic soldiers called the \"Jaeger Brigade.\" - The Jaeger Brigade is\nthe northernmost unit, what the Finnish defense forces has. - As a Deputy commander of Jaeger Brigade, I, of course I have the feeling\nthat we are Finnish army, the most skilled unit in these conditions. - [Johnny] Next, it's briefing time. We head to the command center to get a rundown on what's going on here. This is Arctic Forge. It's a large scale military\nexercise in the high North. It's a collaboration between\nthe militaries of the US, Canada, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. It will include over a thousand troops, all behaving as if they're in\na real world combat scenario. Over at a nearby airfield, the US Army's 11th Airborne Division has just landed, coming in from Alaska. They too are treating this like a real world combat scenario, behaving as if they're quickly coming to the aid of Finland,\nwho's just been attacked. - It is the situation\nwhere Finland is a trouble. Finland is in war. We need help. And now we are piping\ntogether, defending Finland. - [Johnny] American\ntroops will work together with Canadian and Finnish troops to learn how they fight\nhere in the Arctic. Something the Finnish army is expert at. The exercise will play out over this 40-square kilometer\nswath of snowy forest. The blue team will be\ncomprised of Finnish troops with their new NATO allies\nfrom America and Canada, and they'll be trying to\ndefend their territory. And on the other side is the red team, that will be made up of a\nfew hundred Finnish soldiers acting as the invaders. They'll be attacking,\ntrying to take territory. This is the team that I will be on, and I didn't know this before I came, but they really pulled out all the stops to ensure that this is as accurate to real warfare as possible. The blanks in these guns are wood-tipped to mimic the sound and\nkickback of a real bullet. And in addition to these ground forces that I'm embedding with, there's also units of tanks\ndeployed in these woods, hiding in the brush and\npreparing an offensive maneuver. There's artillery cannons standing ready to fire simulated ammunition\nacross the front line. There's surveillance drones in the air with thermal cameras trying\nto detect our position, and real fighter jets ready\nto drop simulated bombs if they see a target. - We are sending the message\nthat we are defending Finland and the eastern border of of NATO, and now we have also\nthe allies troops here to be part of that. - This multi-day exercise\nis about to begin, but first, Felix wants to\nput me through some training. (footsteps crunching)\n(flames roaring) The conscripts here run through\nphysically intense training, like this exercise where they\nrun through a raging fire with all their gear and a gas mask on to simulate facing napalm\nor other incendiary weapons. They practice shooting, shooting on skis, but perhaps most importantly, they prepare to face\nthe real killer up here. - There's cold, and then there's arctic. - Fighting in the Arctic means potentially falling into a river or one of Finland's, nearly 200,000 lakes. So I'm about to get on some skis and fall into this river on purpose and then try to get myself out, all without panicking. So they have to make sure I'm\ncalm before I dig myself out. Man, what have I got myself into here? (water splashing) - [Trainer] Good job. What's your name? What's your name? - Johnny Harris. - [Trainer] Stay down, stay\ndown. What's your name? - Johnny Harris. - [Trainer] What's your job? - I'm a video journalist. - [Trainer] How do you like Finland? - I love Finland. - [Trainer] Is it cold down there? - It is very cold down here. - [Trainer] Okay, you may get up. - Woo! (upbeat music) All right, we're doing\nsprints now to warm up. That's the technique. Okay, we're warmed up. I'm half cold, half warm, but also kind of like\nfeeling some endorphins after that cold water. That was freaking awesome. Wow! I'm dressed and slightly warmed up. Now I'm gonna go learn how to make a fire. (wood hammering) Felix shows me the ways and makes it look pretty\neasy, but now it's my turn. (wood hammering) - You can cut this part out. - Let's see if I can get a single light. Nope. Man, you made it look so easy! - (laughs) You're holding wrongly. - I am not going to survive the night. Oh, this is hard! I'm\ndetermined to make this happen. Okay, the moment of truth here. - Take the rod up a\nlittle bit, yep, yep, yep! You got it! - Okay, there we go.\n- More stuff, more stuff. More birch bark, more birch bark. - Yeah, there she is! - Oh, we got a fire folks! It seems like a lot of\nthese survival skills is about not panicking. Keeping yourself calm even when you kind of wanna freak out. - For US army in the tents,\nthey mostly use gasoline, diesel heaters, propane or whatever. And in Finland, all of our tents are basically heated up with firewood. With stoves. - I keep having to remind myself that there's 5 million\npeople in this country, like that's the size of\nlike the state of Oregon. And yet you guys have\nthis military that like, people come to learn from. It's pretty impressive.\nDo you feel proud of that? - Of course. We don't have the budget to be like a full scale, huge army. We have the conscript service. Thank God we have stick to that. Most of the men have been\nthrough conscript service, have a wartime duty, know how to use guns, know how to ski, like the\nwhole thing is embedded in the Finnish society. That if the bell rings,\nwe are gonna take up arms and do our job to keep\nthe Finland independent. (gentle music) (machine whirring) - The combat exercise has started. Felix has dropped me off\nwith one of the soldiers who's taking me towards the front line. We're now deep in the forest. I arrive to this readiness\nunit of this Arctic platoon, and they're getting ready to deploy, to mount their offensive, to try to take this nearby hill by force. NATO troops will be trying to defend it. These guys are the tip of the\nspear for the Finnish army, and we're about to see how they work. We're getting ready to\ngo to the front line and do this offensive. Every weapon is actually linked to a system that calculates\nthe damage that it would do and where it would hit. The planners of the exercise can assess how each team is doing. They can see where\nartillery fire is going, who's shooting who, how many casualties. (gentle music) We're plowing through this forest. In a BV, it's a carrier vehicle that brings troops through the forest without the need of roads. They seem to be able to\nmove through anything. Okay, we're on the front line here, right where we believe\nthe enemy position is, and we're gonna get our skis on and start moving into the\nenemy's territory to attack. - The red force, which is mainly, or almost all are Finnish conscripts. They are starting to advance to attack. They are not typical conscripts. They are our best conscripts. And they know that on the opposite side, there is US professional soldiers. They are eager to show to US soldiers, what they can do and eager to win. - All the guys start to get\nready to do this maneuver. The drone is about to\ntake off the snowmobiles. There's the comms guy with\nthis big radio over here. We're mobilizing here.\nThis is arctic warfare. (tense music) (object shuffling) So we're moving through\nthis forest right now, clearing this area. We're on the front line\nso we may encounter someone from the other side if these guys are ready. Making this offensive happen, waiting, moving into this enemy territory. (objects shuffling) (guns faintly firing) Shots ring out from a firefight that is happening from another\nunit on the front line. (speaking faintly) (radio chattering faintly) (speaking in foreign language) - As you can hear, further-most squad around the objective area\nis currently in a gunfight. Just, just hang back- - [Johnny] Okay. - And let them do their thing. - Okay. (soldiers talking in foreign language) (guns faintly firing) We're close to our target. And then a few meters later... (noise ringing) (guns firing) Okay, there's a firefight\ngoing on up here. We're gonna go give them some backup. (guns continue firing) (snow shuffling) My unit wins this firefight\nwithin 20 minutes. We've captured these troops. It's a unit mostly made up\nof American army troops. - Guys, we'll check your gear and see if you have anything. Anything we might have interest in. - [Johnny] These American\ntroops came here to train with the Arctic war experts and are finding all kinds of surprises. The first of which is just how to move through such deep snow. - He was like, sinking about this deep. I'm like, all right, I'll be okay. And I go about this\ndeep, and I'm like damn! - [Johnny] And even though\nthey're technically supposed to be enemies on the battlefield, the soldiers can't help\nbut start talking shop. - I had sevens a little smaller. But yeah, you get thermal, you get day, you get zoom, you get lazing grids. Pretty good stuff. Earlier when I was back on the base, I caught up with another\ngroup of US soldiers in the cafeteria. - The Finns are masters of skiing, so they're able to basically use this terrain to their advantage. - The field craft of it is the most interesting part of it. That's one thing you can really\nlearn a lot from the Finns, because there's like the\nUnited States Army way of doing things, technology and this, but like in environments\nlike this, what's old is new. This stuff works. So being able to learn\nthose lessons is critical. - So through this sneaky offensive, we captured this hill, completing our objective for the morning. All of this is being updated\non a live map back at HQ. The day continues with more operations and fighting all over this battlefield. (guns firing)\n(machines whirring) But we're in the high north. The days are short here, and\nsoon the sun is going down. So I get to sleep out in the snow tonight, a little candy bar for the cold night. - These are the worst\nconditions to sleep in. Maybe the worst possible\nweather to sleep in the snow that he's gonna be doing. - Out here in the Finish Forest. And I wouldn't be able\nto do this kind of video if I didn't have a sponsor. In fact, my whole channel is made possible because of sponsors. So I'm going to take a minute to thank today's sponsor who is Incogni, a long-time sponsor of the channel. Incogni is the solution to all of the spam and junk that we get in our emails and telephones in recent years. There's an entire world of data brokers who take your phone number, your address, your age, your browsing history, and they sell it on an open market to lots of different people, corporations, insurance companies, people search sites, who then use that data\nto try to sell you things or try to jack up your insurance prices or make it available for\npeople to search who you are. And perhaps most annoyingly, to send unlimited robocalls\nand junk emails to your world. This has always been an issue for me. I made a video a while back about how annoyed I was by junk mail. I actually tried to stop it\nin that video and was unable. Incogni is the solution\nfor stopping this barrage of junk mail that comes from\nall of these data brokers. What you do is you sign up, you give Incogni permission\nto act on your behalf, to go around and request that your name be taken off these data broker lists. It turns out we have rights\nto be taken off these lists, but it takes a lot of\neffort and time to do it. So what Incogni does is they go out and do all of that work for you, and they keep you updated on the progress. You get this dashboard\nwhere you get to see how many requests they've done, how many have been successful, how many they're still in progress on. It's actually really satisfying. I learned that I was on hundreds of lists and Incogni started the process of getting me off these lists. Incogni is offering a discount to the viewers of this channel. If you use the link in my descriptions, it's incogni.com/johnnyharris. When you use that link and you\nsign up for the annual plan, you get 60% off. I get the annual plan because that means that Incogni is always\nscrubbing these lists. Always looking for my\nname and take it off. So thank you Incogni for\nsponsoring today's video. We got a lot more to do here. So let's get back to the training. (gentle music)\n(objects shuffling) Night has fallen and I'm riding back to\ncamp on a snowmobile. We have our headlights turned off and we're navigating with night vision. There are drones and jets in the air. They'll be able to see us if we create too much light or heat. We're still in combat mode. And because we're already\nso deep in this forest, we're gonna camp out here. Here in the tense darkness, I get briefed by our unit leader. - [Leader] The situation is as follows: so we have our basic defensive posture. Squads are scattered around\nthere in the wilderness. Right now we are making preparations to move into the cold base - [Johnny] Cold base, that\ndoesn't sound very comfortable. I learned that this means we\nneed to sleep in the snow, to make our shelters as cold as possible to avoid being detected by\nthe infrared heat sensors from the drones overhead. - The company commander's intent is to divert the enemy\nrecon with this move. So we will leave our hot tents, move further into the woods. - The problem is, I have no idea how to build the ice shelter that I'm supposed to sleep in tonight. I'm told that step one\nis to put on my skis and start packing the snow down. - [Leader] I really have to\ngo to the company command post to get my orders, so I will\nsee you in a couple of hours. - [Johnny] Okay, perfect.\nThank you so much. I appreciate your help. At this point, despite the\ninstructions I've been given, I still feel out of my depth. Luckily, another conscript\nwanders over to help. Hello?\n- [Soldier] Hi. We haven't met yet. - [Johnny] Hi, I'm\nJohnny. Nice to meet you. How you doing today? - Very nice. - [Johnny] After about 45\nminutes of stomping on this snow, we start cutting the\npacked snow into cubes. These will be like bricks we use to build the walls of my shelter. While we're building, we get\ntalking about what it's like to be in this unit that is\nthe first to go into conflict. - How do you feel about that? Does that kind of make you nervous or... - No, it's just our job to do. - Yeah. - Protect our country, yeah. - [Johnny] All right we've got ourselves a nice-looking shelter here. It's coming together slowly. - Can I offer you a piece\nof Finnish chocolate? - Oh, of course! Thank you so much, wow. That'll warm me up. Oh wow, it's so good. - Best chocolate in the world. - It really seems like it, wow. Cool. I've got a place to sleep. Okay, the snow shelter is finished. Who knew I could make a snow shelter. There it is, this is my shelter. Okay. A little update. It's now after midnight, and\nthe platoon leader has woken me to tell me that my shelter\ndoes not disguise well enough. 'Cause the tarp kind of sticks out, and my thermal signature will be picked up by infrared drones. So we have been up cutting\ndown trees with big branches and putting them on my roof, and then putting the tarp over that so that it's more supportive so\nI can pile it full of snow and then branches on top of that snow. So I've done that for the last hour, and now my shelter is very well\ndisguised from both optical and infrared sensors,\nand I can go back to bed. The problem is, my shelter\nnow looks like this. All the trees that I had to put on it are now poking down into the shelter, and I'm gonna have to sleep among them. As I close my eyes, just out\nof reach of the pine needles. This is where I'm sleeping,\nhere in my ice tree cave. See you tomorrow. I'm exhausted. And as I fall asleep, I get the feeling that I'm glimpsing\nsomething important and old. Not just a military exercise, but an old tradition, a mindset that you can\nreally only understand if you know Finland's unique story. (gentle music)\n(pictures clicking) Finland is stuck between east and west. They were ruled for centuries by Sweden. Then there were conquered and annexed by the Russian Empire in the early 1800s. During that time, Russia tried\nto stamp out Finnish culture, tried to turn this land and its people more and more Russian. But they resisted. And then in the early 1900s, Russia descended into a chaotic revolution that throughout the monarchy, and eventually gave rise to the first-ever large scale communist system. This would become the Soviet Union, the largest country on earth,\nspanning eleven time zones. And right here, little\nFinland took advantage of the chaotic revolution next\ndoor, and they broke free. They declared independence. It got ugly for a few years,\nthere was a bitter civil war, but eventually, Finland emerged as a whole independent country. But the threat didn't go away. The Soviet Union wanted to take back land that they believed belonged to them, but soon they'd find\nthemselves in competition with another growing empire. At first, Stalin and Hitler wanted to avoid war with each other, so they signed a pact promising\nnot to fight one another. But then they secretly agreed to give each other spheres of influence into which the other wouldn't invade. On the list of countries\nthat were fair game for Stalin and his\nSoviet Union was Finland. So just as the winter of 1939\nwas descending onto Europe, hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops flooded across this long\nborder into Finland. They had tanks and air power, and they were fighting\nagainst a much smaller and weaker Finnish army. But despite this, the Finns fought back, Their knowledge of this terrain and their ability to\nblend into these forests, to slip through them on skis and quietly camp out here in\nnegative 40 degree weather. Their attitude of resilience, their commitment to defending their land, all of this allowed them\nto punch above their weight in what is now known as the Winter War. And they lost territory in this war, but not as much as they should have. They were able to maintain their country and their independence. Soon, World War II would\nengulf this whole continent into war, genocide and conquest. That spheres of influence agreement between the Soviets and Germany was broken When Germany started conquering East, this is when Finland\nsaw a chance to win back some of their strategic\nland that they had lost. And they made a difficult choice; accepting troops and\nsupplies from the Nazi regime and going on the offensive\nagainst the Soviet Union to get their land back. It was a strategic move in a brutal war, but one that put Finland\nin a compromising position of aligning with a genocidal regime. With the help of the Nazis, Finland got their land back, and then some, but eventually, the Soviets and their Western allies\nstarted winning the war, beating back the Nazis. The Soviets then turned their attention back onto the Finns and\npushed them back to here. The Soviets made Finland pay them back, made them accept\nresponsibility for the war, and acknowledge that Finland\nhad allied with the Nazis. They were also required to remove German troops from Finland, which they eventually did, though they had to use force to do this in a short conflict in Lapland. By 1945, the devastating\nWorld War was over, and Finland somehow remained intact, having paid a heavy price. And coming out of all of this with some serious lessons learned, a traumatic memory\nimprinted on this nation. (bright music) In our conversation, we've\nheard a lot of people bring up those conflicts, that history seems to be more present here than I normally see. - It's still very vivid,\nthe war history in Finland. - After the Second World War, there's been at least one or\ntwo generations before me. But still, I mean, I do feel this memory because also I, well,\nI know my grandparents were in the war, and\nthose memories just stick. - We have the winter war\nand the war after that. And, well, it's hard to forget, although I was not born here yet, but my parents were\nparticipating in the war, so. - Our history as a small country, also our experiences from\nthe Second World War, I, you know, they're a generation away. So it's like we all have, all our families have\nstories from that time. - The memory about the Winter War and continuous war, it's there. We lost 10% of our soil\nafter the Winter War. I think that nobody wants to\nbe in that position anymore. - It has left us with some sort of wounds, like internal wounds that\nmight play into this, how we feel about Russia. - But this memory isn't just\nabout how they lost land. It's also about how they were somehow able to resist being conquered, especially in the Winter War, when they were fighting entirely alone against a much more powerful military. - We were able to maintain\nthe independence throughout. Ever since we have had to live together with this big neighbor,\nnot in the shadow of it, but under the breadth of Russia. And it has created a\nkind of a special mindset of always being prepared. - What happened in the Second World War? It's a really big impact\non the culture in Finland, I think still, even though\npeople would probably say that, nah, nah, it's not that big of a deal. But I think it's like this, like a very, very big\ninfluence still today, - [Johnny] Knowing this\nhistory made spending time with these soldiers much more meaningful. Almost all of these\nsoldiers are conscripts, mostly young men who are required\nto serve for up to a year. Finland being one of the\nfew countries in Europe that still requires their\npeople to serve in the military. This provides yet another layer of collective memory and shared experience that makes its way into every\nFinnish household and family. - [Interviewee] People of\nFinland, we are not afraid. We are concerned. We know what's in the east.\nWe have never forgotten that. - (sighs) What a night. It's time to go. I have to break this fort down. I slept as well as you\nwould expect in a nice cave that I made here in the Arctic Circle. A lot faster to kill it than to create it. But that's how it goes, I guess. - The platoon leader told\nme that pine needle makes for some good tea. Gotta try it out. I don't have any coffee. Pine needle tea, let's do this. Oh, that's nice. (tense music)\n(machines whirring) We are headed towards another front line when the BV gets stuck. So the platoon is here\nin this wide open area, fully exposed to the sky. We spend an hour trying to get out, but we get interrupted with the news that a recon drone has\nspotted our location. And soon an F18 hornet\nis speeding our way, and within seconds it\ndrops a simulated payload that hit right on target. The target being us, killing\nnearly everyone in our unit. The surviving team\ncontinues the simulation, acting as they would in\na real world scenario. They take stock of the wounded, they carry them out to safety. And as all of this is happening, the platoon leader breaks the\nnews that he was hit as well. - [Leader] I'm dead as well.\n- [Johnny] Oh you're dead too. - [Leader] There won't be any advantages, this platoon is not doing anything. - It's game over for my unit. We had a good run, and I'm certainly much more informed on what arctic warfare actually means. My time at the base is over. My next stop is the Russian border. But before I say goodbye to the troops, Felix insists that we end our adventure in a traditionally Finnish way; a sauna Saunas are a big part of the culture here, and military is no exception. This is a real sauna,\nheated by those embers. (pipes squeaking)\n(attendees chattering) And even though my training is done, I can't help but head down to an ice hole cut into the river. - [Onlooker] He's done this before. - I'm alive. I got it. Woo! That was amazing. Oh man,\nthere's nothing better! (onlookers chuckling)\nThere is nothing better. - [Onlooker] That's crazy! (group laughing) - Okay, now it's time to head east towards that blood soaked\nborder with Russia. To continue my journey, to understand the\nFinnish security mindset, it's becoming clear that the\nmilitary is just one layer. The rest of the story\ntakes place elsewhere in underground bunkers,\nhiding beneath cities, and along this line in the woods, whose violent history is\nstill on everyone's minds. After World War II, Finland had to play a\ndelicate balancing act. They found themselves\nonce again in the middle of two big hostile forces. Their former invaders, the Soviet Union and their allies to the east, and the US and their\nEuropean allies to the west. Finland was squeezed between\nthis global Cold War, but being a totally\nindependent, sovereign democracy that was increasingly leaning West, Finland still had to deal with the fact that this superpower, the Soviet Union, like all superpowers, felt entitled to a sphere of influence\naround its borders. Finland knew all too well\nhow easily the Soviets could violently cross this long border to secure that influence. It was etched in blood in\ntheir collective memory. So while Europe was hardening\ninto an American-led alliance, Finland had to walk a tightrope. - We have always known that\nRussia is or can be a threat, but always still, you know,\nfocusing very much on defense and the potential threat which\nRussia might be opposing. - People saw a risk in kind\nof stirring up the situation that we had in the area. The feeling was that there was less to gain by an NATO membership than\nby continuing to take care of the territorial defense by ourself. - [Johnny] In retrospect, we now see that Finland played this\nsituation very well. They promised to stay non-aligned, meaning joining neither alliance, and instead, they would\ngo on to continue building a capable military based\non mandatory service and founded on the\nprinciples of resilience, discipline, endurance, and\na commitment to keep alive that collective memory of the importance of defending your soil. And somewhat famously, the sauna helped in keeping the peace. During the tense years of the Cold War, one Finnish president would\ninvite the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, to strip\ndown and sauna with him, where they would talk\ngeopolitics, build rapport. Many believe this was one important way that Finland avoided tension\nwith the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the border between\nthese two countries thrived, trade flowed, tourists came, these neighbors stayed peaceful, but eventually the Soviet Union fell, and global peace seemed\nright around the corner. Most countries in Europe\npaired down their military. They did away with mandatory\nservice, but Finland did not. They stayed the course of\nvigilance and preparedness, their proximity too close, their collective memory too\nstrong to let them let down. - Quite the many countries\nhas lost their ability to fight this kind of a close fight that we are expert on. - I guess it's also the consciousness that the reality could be so different if we lived in an autocracy like Russia. - But soon, the careful tightrope that Finland walked for\ndecades would soon be shaken. - [Newscaster] Ukraine is\nunder attack by land, sea, and cities across the country\ncome under intensify attack. - Well, to be honest, I remember it like it would\nhave happened yesterday. I stayed awake that night\nand that changed everything. It was a complete disappointment, and the trust was gone in one night. - I was at home, he signal\nwas that now is the time to really join NATO, and really from the point- This is also difficult to describe, not only from the point\nof view that we want to take care of our own security, we want to feel safer, but also the consciousness\nthat we need to contribute to the security of our values, and essentially the entire alliance, - The support for NATO went up\nfirst 53% in the first weeks, and then up to 76% and\nlater, even over 80%, people reconsidered the\nsituation as a whole overnight. - [Johnny] Finland and\ntheir neighbor Sweden joined the Alliance in April, 2023, putting a final end to\ndecades of non-alignment and the diplomatic balancing act with their neighbor to the east. - I think it's a little sad. We lost our neutrality, but I think it was the only only choice to guarantee our freedom. - I'm very happy that we are now members, so I think we feel very\ngood, we feel protected. We are not alone. Everybody believed that being neutral will help Finland stay out of trouble. But when Russia attacked Ukraine, it showed us that, okay, we can trust in us being neutral. - Now I'm safer. Definitely\nsafer, I think, so. To be a member of NATO, and it's, our army is very good. And we hope it will continue because Mr. Trump speaks this and that. - Now that Trump is in office and it seems impulsive, then that brings us more of\nthese feelings of anxiousness. But if everything is stable in USA, then I think NATO feels also\nstable and brings peace. - I feel that Finland\njoining NATO was necessary. I feel quite good about it at the moment. - After the attack, like, yeah, like it's... It was like the best\ndecision ever, in my opinion. - Before we joined NATO, a lot of people were kind of stressed about if Russia was gonna come here next. But now that we've joined NATO, I think a lot of that stress has gone away and there's way less\nanxiety about a war coming. I feel much more secure. - The civilian society opened their eyes, okay, this is happening. We need to do some decisions now. It's good that we did those decisions. - Why is it good? - So that we would never be alone again. (gentle music) - In the Autumn of '23, Russia started to\ninstrumentalize migration. - Up at this snowy border\ncrossing at the north, Russia started dropping off refugees who had come to Russia seeking asylum. But now they were sending them to Finland, presumably with the hope of causing debate and division over\nmigration within Finland, one of several hybrid war tactics that Russia has used to sabotage the West. We are 15 minutes away\nfrom the Russian border, in a very rural part of the country. And I'm very curious what that\nborder looks like right now. There's not a single\nsoul in sight, no cars. Suomi is Finland, and then right there is Russia. So not too long ago, this was\na thriving border crossing. Like people would come from Finland into Russia to get cheap gas. People would come from Russia into Finland for tourism and stuff\nthat they could buy here. People have relatives on\ndifferent sides of the border. But after this escalation in Ukraine turned into this ghost\ntown that it is today. It's looking closed. Oh man, this is ominous. Okay, here I am. Here's the gate to Russia, and it is totally closed. - In 2019, it was around 9.5 million border crossing on a yearly basis. And now we are in a situation where the border is closed. - Completely silent out here. Let's see if I can get in. - Hey, good morning!\nHi, how are you doing? (group chattering) - [Patrol] Yeah, I'm called Johnny too. - [Johnny] Oh, no way! - At the moment we have no\npolitical contact at all with with Russia due to the fact that they blatantly\nviolated international law. - Okay, we're at a border station now. (group chattering) - Hello.\n- Hi there, Johnny. - Are you first time in Finland? - Yeah. First time. Training with the soldiers. They think a lot about this border. They think a lot about\nthe potential threat. Pretty interesting to\nsee how quiet it is here. Even though all the border\ncrossings are now closed, the guards here still\npatrol the line like normal. So tell me about this dog. What's his job or her job? Things here are different now. Not just because the drug-sniffing\ndog has less work to do because no one's crossing, but there's new tension in the air, tension that awakens some\nof the ghosts of the past. (ominous piano music) Those winter war battles were\nfought on this very ground, - The, let's say border guards\nin service of Finnish nation. I think we all think maybe a bit more about the military history of the areas. Border guard troops\nhave fought here before. So we are kind of the legacy bearers of those who came before us. Of course, I would\nthink that everyone here from time to time thinks\nabout those things. I think maybe it's one\nof these unifying events in our nation's history. Maybe that's why it's on people's\nminds, all over the place. - [Johnny] All around this border area, you see reminders of what\nhappened all those winters ago and now this ghost town of a border and all of its quiet tension is just another visual\nreminder of why they prepare, why they have always prepared. Do you think it'll open back up? - It's really difficult to say that. - [Johnny] Yeah. - It's not in our hands. - [Johnny] Yeah. - As you can say, the world\nis changing so rapidly, but we are here and we're ready. Whatever is decided. - They tell me I can\ndrive along the border as long as I don't try to cross it. But before I leave, I have to ask. On the inside, do you guys have any maps that you can show me or any or any visual? - At the moment, no. Actually, a bit restricted on that one. - [Johnny] That's what\nI figure, yeah. Okay. - Well, thanks guys. Driving now, right along\nthe Russian border. Long, long border. Very wooded, very snowy, very quiet. Okay, here we are. That is Russia. Just over that fence. Finland has built so much\nof its security strategy around the memories that\nexist here on this border. The memories of bloodshed and violence of their land being taken. But when you're here at this border, it is quiet, it's silent,\nit's peaceful, it's beautiful. But in the air is this tension, this tension of... Will that memory come back? Finland is very, very dedicated to making sure that doesn't happen. (gentle music) As I head back to Helsinki, the Capitol, something that one of the\nborder guards said to me stuck in my head. - I don't know if it's unique, but the preparedness kind of stretches into all sectors of life. So it's not only the\nmilitary and police and this, but also the civilians. Infrastructure is integrated quite well. - [Johnny] As an American,\nit's hard to think of defense as anything other than a\nlarge powerful military. But it's becoming clear that here they think of it very differently. The next piece of the\npuzzle to understand this is hidden under this city. It represents one of the\nmost important layers to the Finnish defense strategy, to the mindset of preparedness. And it's something that basically no other country on earth has. But that could prove key\nto this country's security and might even be a part of explaining why these people are considered\nthe happiest in the world. There's this little glass box right here that I'm about to go into. 'Cause apparently there's\na huge bunker underneath. I love bunkers. Let's see. And I keep seeing people\nwith hockey sticks descending into the glass box. What's going on down\nhere? We're going down. - [Onlooker] Yes, we are. - [Johnny] We're going very down. - [Onlooker] We're going to the shelter. - [Johnny] Yes, cool! Wow. Wow, this place is, feels like you're in a cave. So we are now approximately\n20 meters below ground. - Sure enough, there's\na huge bunker down here. It's one of many massive\nunderground shelters all over the country. - In Helsinki, we have\nfive and a half thousand independent shelters, and\nwe have sheltering places for over 900,000 people. And Helsinki is only 680,000 strong. It's not in scale, but still, this shelter is intended for\nthis residential area only. - [Johnny] I see. Okay, but what are these bunkers for? - Flying objects, shrapnel. The shelter is making turns like this, so the pressure gets\nabsorbed to the bedrock. And then the first manmade\nbarricade is that pressure wall, which is theoretically nuclear-proof. That's actually, that's the small one. - Oh, it's that small? - It is the small one.\n(speaking in foreign language) The second manmade barricade\nagainst weapon effects is the chemical door,\nwhich we can keep all the toxic elements out of the shelter and we can keep slides over\npressure on the shelter. - [Johnny] This is not a normal\nthing for a country to do. I explored the bunker\nculture of Switzerland, which is also very unique, but almost no other country on earth has this much bunker\nspace for their people. And it isn't long before I'm told that these bunkers are directly\ntied to the same history, the same memory that we've\nbeen hearing about everywhere. - And since the Second World War where the biggest threat was airplane, and airplane carried weapons, these hard shell and and closable quarters became only way to protect\ncitizens against weapon effects. We have been keeping it in\nour legislation ever since. - After the experience\nof the second World War, we saw the need to really\nprotect our civilian population as best as we could. We never gave up, not even\nwhen the Cold War's finished, unlike many other European countries. - [Johnny] Yeah. - So we've always had a very clear view of the threat picture that we face because of our geopolitical location. - We go through this next door, and I understand why I saw so many people carrying hockey sticks down here. (smooth music) This is so cool. He just told me that they rent\nthis out to business people who are the ones who are responsible for making use out of\nit and maintaining it. - That's the dual-use purpose. - Yeah, and they manage\nall of the coordination? - Yeah. And then they pay us rent\nand it is being maintained. - That's incredible. Wow. - Is there food storage down here then? No, because you don't need food. - [Johnny] I guess you only need water. - Yes, a person is designed\nso we cannot live without air for no more than three minutes. If we had air, we cannot\nlive without water for no more than three days. Person, which has air and\nwater can live without food for up to three weeks. Again, it's not supposed to be nice. This isn't a hotel. It is a place where you\nkeep yourself alive. - In Finland, bunkers are\nused for a lot of things, not just hockey rinks,\nbut a pool, like this one, that can be quickly drained\nin case of an emergency, or as I see when I walk through this door, a parking garage business. And the use case I\nfound most surprising... Oh wow. It just keeps\non going, look at this. (bright music) - This must be the world's\nmost secure playground. - [Onlooker] Must be! (laughs) - [Johnny] Yeah, yeah. How many square meters is all of this? - 18,000. - [Johnny] How much of it is being used? - 17,000. - The bunker is just the beginning. They walk me through\nall the specific roles and responsibility for every person who comes into this shelter\nlooking for protection. They tell me about the courses and classes that almost\nevery member of society takes for emergency preparedness. And this is where it all clicks for me; what that border guard was saying about how the military is just the\nbeginning of their defense, but that security and\npreparedness is everywhere. Finland isn't a place where the government protects the people. It's a place where the\npeople protect each other through a tightly woven\nweb of commitments, responsibilities, values, training, and a shared worry that no\none ever really forgets about. And let me just tell you, I could kind of get a glimpse of the depth of this web, this commitment. But I could tell that\nit goes so much deeper than I could ever fully grasp on a short visit, much less\ncommunicate in a short video. But it's here, it's unique, and it's deeply inside of the minds of everyone that I talk to. - It's clear that, you\nknow, when you have a border that's also a NATO border now, then you have to be\nprepared for all eventually - We have had our difficulties\nwith all of our neighbors. - [Onlooker] Yes. - Vikings, Swedish, Russians. We have had them all. - The civil defense man\ninvoking the conquest of the Vikings to evangelize\nemergency preparedness, all while standing in\nfront of a playground inside of a 20-meter deep bunker. Really says it all. This place is unique. What led me to Finland was a curiosity about its military capabilities. Small country with a big capable military. Its arctic warfare skills, its\nunique geopolitical position. Its recent accession to NATO. But after exploring the\nsecurity of this nation, I'm seeing a country where every person has some role to play in the defense of the people and the land. They prepare and they train, not just in military bases, but in office buildings,\nin business board rooms. They all know where to go\nin case of an emergency, because of course they do. That's where they play\nhockey on Thursday nights. But more importantly, they know what to do if an emergency arrives at their doorstep. So as I've been mulling over this question of why Finland continues to be the happiest country on\nearth, I had some theories. Maybe it's because they drink\ndouble the amount of coffee of other European countries, or maybe it's because they\nspend so much time in saunas. Or maybe it's because in\naddition to being a rich country with plenty of abundance, they also have what a lot of\nother rich countries lack; a sense of collective belonging. A unity that is yes, provoked by a threat, but that has turned into\na source of empowerment and confidence for the\npeople who all feel united in a goal of securing their freedom. The way the world is\ngoing, the Finns may need to pull upon this preparedness. The melting ice to the\nnorth is turning the Arctic into a new domain for\ngeopolitical competition. And to the South, Finland is already seen and responding to Russian sabotage of internet cables in the Baltic Sea. And these border guards are preparing for increased military activity and potential sabotage along this line. Felix left me with a gift, a badge from the Yeager Brigade, a symbol of friendship and belonging. And a reminder to me of the time I got to\nglimpse this unique place, this special mindset that\nkeeps this country safe and these people deeply united. (gentle music)"}]}

(soft music) What we're looking at here\nis the number of Americans that don't make enough\nmoney for basic survival. So like a family of four,\ntwo parents, two kids, living off of $31,000 a year or less. That's considered poverty\nin the United States and there's millions of people who live with that kind of income. The U.S. government spends\nabout a trillion dollars every year helping these\npeople meet their basic needs. In recent decades, a lot of that money has been flowing through a middleman, private corporations who are\nsupposed to be more efficient in administering this money. - So welfare is big business. And of course, that's the\nirony of this whole thing, that there's so much money\nto be made from poverty. (pensive music) - Now this is not easy\nstuff to understand. We're talking about\ngovernment welfare programs and bureaucracy. Sometimes they're intentionally\nhard to understand and these corporations don't really want to be known by anyone. But if you start to dig,\nwhich we've been doing, and you look deep enough into this, you start to see what all\nof this actually looks like, who's actually getting rich, what the incentives\nare within this system, where the loopholes are, and whether or not this is\nactually benefiting the people that it's designed to benefit. So in this video, I'm gonna show you who gets rich off the poor. And I'm just gonna do a few case studies that demonstrate how this works. I'll be making a list of examples here going from what I see is\nthe least egregious abuse of this system to the most. I am bracing myself to\nget sued or intimidated by the companies that I'm\ncalling out in this video because that's how a lot of these powerful shadowy companies work. So as always, every\nassertion in this video is rigorously fact-checked\nand in my sources. Lawyers, go check that first before you send me your\ncease and desist order. Thank you. And with that, let's look at\nwho gets rich off the poor. Let's go back to this graph one last time and just zoom back to the 1950s where you can see that the poverty rate was double what it is today. It's like 22%. This was really bad. And it led to the president\nat the time declaring war. - And this administration\ntoday, here and now, declares unconditional\nwar on poverty in America. We shall not rest until that war is won. - So, \"A War on Poverty\" by\nLyndon B. Johnson in 1964. This is what that war looked like. This big line. This is social spending as a share of GDP. You can see this is where\nhe gives this speech, right here, this flat line. Social spending just\nskyrockets right after. The government spends tons of money for this war on poverty. That money goes towards\nprograms like Medicare and Medicaid, food\nstamps, public education, which is why you see this big dip. 22%, all the way down to 12, 13%. And for a time, all this spending worked. Poverty declined 30% in five years. But eventually, progress slowed. The government kept spending\nand people got tired of it. The economy wasn't doing well and people were tired of subsidizing these welfare programs. And that's where this guy comes in. - My friends, some years ago, the federal government\ndeclared war on poverty and poverty won. - This is where things start\nto get a little bit murky. So we needed help. We got it from Ann Kim, who is an expert, who literally wrote the\nbook on this history and the modern day poverty economy and sat down with us to\ntalk through this history and how it works today. - Remember during the 1980s, we had this, well, no, you don't\nremember the 1980s. (laughs) Well, during the 1980s, there was really this mythologization, if that's a word, of the CEO. At the same time, the government\nspending was ballooning. Economic times were not that great. So Americans were not\nfeeling particularly generous about funding social services programs. And so the CEOs were really\nkind of held up on a pedestal as the ones who are\ngoing to make government just as efficient as they\nmade their own companies. - Poverty is a big business\nhere in the United States and the government is\nmaking decisions right now that will affect millions of people. And yet what I've been finding is it's hard to keep up on all of this, how this stuff is being reported and what is trustworthy and factual. Lately, Medicaid portals\nhave been shutting down in all 50 states, thanks to a Trump\nadministration funding freeze. This could result in\nmillions of Americans, low-income Americans, going without care. This is huge and it's not\nreally being reported on. And when there's no accountability, bad policies can go unchecked. I'm saying all of this because it has to do with\nthe sponsor of today's video who is more important\nthan ever, in my opinion. Thank you, Ground News,\nfor sponsoring our video and for existing in this\nimportant time for journalism.

So it's the 1980s, Reagan wants to rein in\nall of this spending. He's also afraid that Americans\nare becoming too reliant on the welfare system. So he kicks off a bunch of changes that over time would lead\nto a fundamental shift in delivering income support\nto low-income populations. - They wanted to privatize\nMedicaid, Medicare, prisons, air traffic control. - This privatization\nof government spending started under Reagan, but it continued into the\nfuture administrations, especially under Bill\nClinton, who helped expand it. And the fundamental shift looks like this. We're gonna be using a graphic like this, not only for right now, but for the future cases\nof how this works today. Taxpayers give money to the government. The government used to give money to citizens in need directly. But after these reforms, the money would start to be\ndistributed to the states. The states would then\nhire for-profit companies to do the complicated work\nof distributing this money to eligible people in need. They would be responsible for making sure that no one's abusing the system, determining who's eligible and who's not. And the thinking here\nwas that the government is much less efficient\nthan private companies. And that is true in most cases. And that if we apply\nbusiness and the free market and profit motives to welfare, that the for-profit companies would make this more efficient, less government spending, less waste, and less over-reliance\non the welfare system. And the big part of all of this is that there would be more requirement for people to be looking for a job or be working in order\nto qualify for benefits. And who would verify that\napplicants are actually working? These for-profit companies. And so this is how our\nwelfare system works today in a very kind of American way. It is administered by private companies that you've never heard about, who are given lots of\nmoney from the government to dole it out to people in need. - So Reagan started this\nprivatization train, and it was really President Bill Clinton who not only hopped on board that train, but got it accelerating\nto his destination, which was total privatization of a lot of social services in America. - Okay, so that's the context here. It's been 45 years since\nthis big experiment began of privatizing our welfare system. I've always wondered, like, did this work? So that's sort of been the curiosity at the heart of this story. Is government more efficient? Are we saving money? Is this helping vulnerable populations in a more efficient way? The answer is, in some cases, yes. Like, there have been positive outcomes of outsourcing to contractors within the welfare system\nand public spending. A good example of that is food stamps that used to come in these paper coupons, but now are delivered\nelectronically on a debit card. This is more secure, it's more efficient. It ensures that people use these for food. There are a lot of instances\nwhere private companies have made government\nspending more efficient, but the purpose of this\nvideo is to shine a light on the many instances\nwhere private companies have gotten really rich off of this system in a way that has not benefited the most vulnerable and\nneedy people in our country, the poor, the elderly,\nchildren in need, the disabled. So finally, the reason\nyou clicked on this video, let's draw up this list of\nwho gets rich off the poor. And for that, I'm gonna need\nto look at all these papers, so we need more space. Let's go to the big table. All right. Okay, so the first one on our list is slightly adjacent to the\nprivatization of welfare, but it follows the same\nincentives and dynamics. And it has to do with taxes. One of the ways that the\ngovernment subsidizes the lives of lower income\npeople is through a tax credit. So when you file your taxes, you show that you've been\nworking, you've made money, but you didn't make that much money, and therefore you qualify for\nan earned income tax credit. If you have kids, it goes up and it kind of maxes out at around $7,000. This is a very simple thing. In a lot of countries,\nyou like check a box and you get this refund or\nthis subsidy to your life. But in the United States,\nit looks like this. This is a 45-page instruction manual about all the specifics on\nthe earned income credit, something that should be so simple and that is a key way of helping lower income\npeople live their lives. The tax code here in the United States is deathly complicated, intentionally designed to be so to make certain companies rich. And this is one way that works. I have a lot of feelings about this. I made a whole video\non \"The New York Times\" about this very thing, but I didn't focus on this aspect of it. Because it's so complicated, low-income people who\nqualify for this credit don't wanna fill it out themselves. And so they go to a tax preparer. Enter this guy. Well, not this guy specifically, but a guy like this representing\na company like this. Liberty Tax is one of many\ntax preparation companies that advertise to\nlow-income people to come in so that they can prepare their taxes and get them in on the\nearned income tax credit. But we now know they do so\nusing some pretty shady means. There's a lawsuit. Lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit. District of Columbia\nversus Liberty Tax Service. Liberty Tax was recently sued\nfor luring low-income people by saying that they will\nprepare their taxes for them only to deceive these customers by secretly skimming extra money off the top of their tax refund, which remember includes the\nearned income tax credit that is meant to subsidize their lives. Liberty Tax also gives out loans to people saying that they can pay them back once they get their tax refund. - But what that really has\ndone is create a market for high-interest cash products like refund anticipation loans or refund anticipation checks, which are basically just payday loans that are secured by the refund. And so this predatory industry has grown to take advantage of the complexity of an incredibly important benefit that a lot of poor people\ncount on every year. - These loans would often\ncome with high interest rates and unexpected fees. In fact, the pricing in all of this has been kind of a black box, allowing Liberty Tax to take advantage of low-income Americans trying\nto get in on the benefit that they are entitled to\nbecause of this tax credit. Okay, and this is where\nI have to come clean. I worked for this company. Not for very long and\nnot in any high position. I was one of these Statue of Liberty guys. One winter, I was home from university waiting for a security clearance\nfor an internship at NATO, and I needed money. And so I found this job\nbeing the Statue of Liberty holding this sign. I didn't know what the sign said, okay? But it probably said something like, \"Need money today? \"Apply for a $500 to $6,250 easy advance.\" In other words, I was probably a part of luring desperate people\nin to get a bad loan or to have their tax refund\nskimmed by this corporation. I had no idea, and I'm sorry. Liberty is just one of many corporations who has gotten in on these schemes, targeting low-income\npeople to try to get in on their tax credits. And to me, this is actually\na failure of our tax system. For this segment of the population, this should be a very easy thing like it is in every other country. A box on a free government website that you can fill out in five minutes. But instead, we've got a\nprivatized corporate middleman who is making all of\nthis money off the poor. Okay, number two, housing. So here in the US, instead of building big\npublic housing complexes like they do in some countries\nand like we used to do, the privatized version of\nthe American government gives vouchers to low-income people and allows them to go choose a house. And the government will basically pay for a portion of their rent. This is called Section 8 housing. And there are landlords that specialize in renting to Section 8 tenants, getting this government subsidy voucher that goes to pay for the rent. But what you find is that\nsome of these landlords jack up their prices because they know the\ngovernment will pay for it. Like here in DC, an apartment that should\ncost $1,600 a month the landlord might charge\nalmost $1,000 more, like $2,500 a month, well\nabove the market price. Knowing that the government who has poor oversight over this program won't pick up on this and will subsidize that inflated price. Now I'm not just making this up, those are real numbers\nfrom an investigation here in DC by the Washington Post who found that the DC government is overpaying thousands of apartments to the tune of a million\ndollars every month here in little DC. But this is happening\nall over the country. Enriching landlords while depleting the assisted housing fund, all while distorting the market. Like this is not free market, this is a totally distorted thing. Number three on our list\nis corporate middlemen, which is kind of a big section. I'll try to work through\nit fairly concisely, but it's kind of the biggest one here. This is where a lot of people\nget really rich off the poor. Remember from our history\nsection just a few moments ago that Ronald Reagan shook\nup the welfare system by instead of giving money\ndirectly to people in need, instead giving it to the states who would then give it\nto a corporate middleman who would then distribute it. And that corporate middleman also had to kind of determine\nthe eligibility of people, making sure they're working\nor they're looking for a job. And all of that is a lot of work and these corporations were\nthe ones to be doing it. - So these are the folks who are getting government contracts to act as government in\nrunning welfare programs. They're basically agents\nof the government. They are mercenaries\nfor the public sector. They're making huge decisions that benefit the everyday\nlives of low-income people. One of these companies, for instance, was a company called Maximus, which is one of the largest welfare services providers today. They had revenues of\nabout $88 million in 1995. And just a few years later, their revenues were\nalready up to $500 million. And today they're a $4.9 billion business. - Now this was exactly\nthe point for Reagan and his reformers. These corporate middlemen were supposed to be much more efficient in administering this government money. And indeed, they are for-profit companies and they operate much more efficiently than the government itself, cutting costs and looking for ways to do things more efficiently. But let's remember, this is\nnot like a normal corporation like McDonald's that is\nselling a product to a customer that can go somewhere else. Let's see what happens. (pensive music) A few years ago, Maximus\ntook over Tennessee's health insurance program, state-run health insurance program. It's called Medicaid. And what you saw is that many\nchildren and elderly people very quickly were booted\nout of the program. They were found ineligible. There was a 23% increase in the number of uninsured\nchildren in the state. That's more than any other\nstate at the time, 2018. It took me a while to\nget my head around this. Like why would a for-profit company want to kick children and old people off of the state health insurance program? I'll explain in just a sec, but let's look at one more example. In 2016, Maximus took over the\nMedicaid program in Kansas. And soon thereafter, applicants\nstarted to see huge delays in their applications. Backlogs started to build up, which remember what\nwe're talking about here. This isn't abstract. This is vulnerable people, in this case, mostly elderly people, not being able to access\ntheir basic health needs for weeks and sometimes months because their application was\npending for a very long time, meaning Maximus was working on it, but presumably very slowly. And that's because children\nand low-income people and elderly people are\nnot Maximus' customer. They do not have an incentive\nto serve those people, partly 'cause those people\ncan't go anywhere else. Those people think that\nthey're interacting with the government. They don't know who Maximus is. And mostly because their main job is to get more government contracts and then to cut costs\nso that they can capture as much of that government\ncontract as profit. So in this case, what that\nmeans is cutting staff, making it as cheap as possible to process these applications. This answers my question about\nwhy a company like Maximus would want to get people off the rolls, to deem them ineligible\nfor these benefits, because it's cheaper for them. They are motivated to find\npeople who do not qualify and to pare down their list so they have fewer people to work on, which is less cost for them. So yes, there is\ncost-cutting and efficiency that's happening here, but it happens to be at the expense of vulnerable, needy people who the government is\ntrying to give money to. Now, actually, I don't blame\nMaximus very much for this. I don't think they're bad people. I think they provide a very\nuseful service in most cases. We should expect a corporation\nto behave like this. The definition of a for-profit corporation is someone who does\neverything in their power to make money for their company. That is their job. So without proper\noversight and competition and regulation and performance review, these corporations should be expected to minimize the resources\nthey have to put into it, processing applications\nand administering benefits. And another point of fairness here, if you look at the financials of Maximus, they're not some crazy profitable company. Yes, they bring in billions of dollars. They've captured a huge amount of this government services market. Their gross profit margin is\n20%, which seems like a lot, but if you actually look\nat their net profit margin, which is kind of their\nmore typical profit margin, it's like 3%. That's a pretty poor\nperformance for a company. They're not insanely profitable. The CEO did make $7.3 million last year in full compensation and they did spend over a million dollars in lobbying and funding elections. My point here is corporate middlemen who administer welfare\nare not robber barons and they're not running\nsome corrupt scheme, but they are for-profit corporations who will cut costs where they can. And if they're not held\naccountable for doing that, the people who suffer are the people who are already vulnerable\nand needy in our country, which is what all these\nprograms are meant to help. - Because they're one of\nonly a handful of companies that are in this business, you can get away with a lot of behaviors that may not fly in a more\ncompetitive marketplace. - I remember interacting\nwith these companies. I didn't know I was interacting with them until I started reporting the story, but when my son was like one and a half, he was diagnosed with autism and we started to look\naround for services, realized our insurance\ndidn't cover anything, so we went to Medicaid and we qualified. And my wife has spent hours\nand hours on the phone with what I now know was\na corporate middleman trying to work through these\napplications and processes. And it was mind numbingly\ncomplicated and difficult and the wait times were so long and the paperwork and the hoops that we had to jump through. And I remember feeling a lot of anger at the inefficiency of the government. The government has no incentive to perform because we're not their customer. What I realize now is that I was dealing with a corporation. I was not the customer,\nIz was not the customer, my son, Henry, who needed\nservices was not the customer. And in fact, complicated\nforms and more wait times and process is actually more business for these corporate middlemen. They have an incentive to sell\nmore paperwork to all of us. To me, that is a distortion\nof what Ronald Reagan dreamt about of corporations swooping in and making our government more efficient. Okay, that's corporate middlemen. Let's move on to number four. Medicaid dentists. Now, I've had some positive\nexperiences with Medicaid. When I was a freshly married in my young 20s university\nstudent with no insurance and we had our first baby, I got hit with a $10,000\nbill from the hospital and freaked out and went\nto the billing department at the hospital and they told\nme about this magical thing called Medicaid for someone like me who was very low income at the time. And lucky for me, whoever the benefits\ncontractor in Utah was handled it very well and\nit really saved my bacon. But if you look at all sides of Medicaid, you start to see entire industries that exist to take advantage\nof the Medicaid system. A good example of this is dentistry. - It's created an enormous\nbusiness opportunity for some dentists who see\nthat they can make a living treating exclusively Medicaid patients. - Unlike regular private insurance, Medicaid doesn't reimburse very\nmuch for dental procedures. So because of that, a lot of dentists don't take\nMedicaid as an insurance. And on the other side, there are some dentists\nthat only take Medicaid. They specialize in appealing to patients who qualify for Medicaid, getting them in and doing as\nmany procedures as possible to get in on those Medicaid benefits. And once again, if we're talking rational corporate behavior and incentives, these offices will often\ntarget lower income or disabled or elderly patients who are less likely to\nadvocate for themselves and against medically\nunnecessary procedures. - So inevitably what's happened over time is that this market has turned\ninto a very exploitative one where dentists have been prosecuted for charging for procedures\nthat didn't exist or procedures that were\ncompletely unnecessary. For instance, there was a\ndentist in North Carolina who was prosecuted for having\nperformed 17 root canals on a three-year-old toddler. - And it's not just one bad\napple in North Carolina. This is a lawsuit where the US government settled with a company called Kool Smiles and they are a Medicaid\nspecific dental franchise who had to pay close to $24 million because an investigation found that they were performing\ndental operations that were not medically necessary. They were taking\nadvantage of poor patients in order to get more money from Medicaid. According to the lawsuit, they performed tooth extractions, gave out stainless steel crowns, did root canals on babies\nthat did not need them. Like there are multiple\nthings really wrong with this. Obviously, exploiting a government system to deplete the Medicaid\nfund is one aspect, but performing like dental\nsurgeries on people, root canals on babies for money is a level of greed and\ncorporate exploitation that I cannot really get my head around. But again, in a world where companies will maximize profits, this is to be expected if the incentive structure\nis set up that way. Let's get to number five, which is similar to the dental clinics, but it has to do with kidneys. Here in the US, lower income people are disproportionately\nplagued with kidney failure, a disease where your kidneys fail and your blood can't be\ncleaned by your kidneys. So you need a machine\ncalled a dialysis machine to clean your blood for you. Luckily, since the '70s, the United States now heavily subsidizes people who need dialysis\nfor their kidneys. And dialysis is meant to\nbe a temporary intervention while you wait for a kidney transplant. There's always a long waiting\nlist for a kidney transplant, so you're on dialysis until\nyou can get a transplant, which increases your chances of living. It is a wonderful thing that\nthe government subsidizes this because it saves a lot of lives. But inevitably, here\ncomes the exploitation. - Overnight, it instantly\ncreated an industry opportunity to offer dialysis because now the government\nwas going to pay for it. - One of these companies is called DaVita. I think they're the largest\ndialysis center company in the United States. And because of this set of incentives, we can start to piece together\nhow they would behave. - And the thing again about dialysis is like Medicaid dentistry,\nit's a volume business. The government pays dialysis\ncenters per treatment. And last year, it was\nabout $380 per treatment. So it is unfortunately in the interest of dialysis companies\nthat run dialysis centers to keep those machines occupied as many hours of the day as they can to cycle through as many\npatients as they can because an empty dialysis machine is $380 that they're not making. - Okay, so a company making sure that their machines are\nbeing used at full capacity is actually, there's nothing\ninherently wrong with that. That is a company just using\nits resources efficiently, administering a life-saving treatment. But that's kind of just the beginning. What you see in these\nfor-profit dialysis centers is less staff to help with the treatment and you see higher death rates. And this is where it becomes\nso clear where the failure is. You see 17% fewer referrals\nfor kidney transplant. Meaning these people who are on a temporary\ndialysis intervention who are supposed to be waiting\nfor a kidney transplant are kept on the machines longer because a for-profit company makes money the longer they're in the chair. So why would they refer them\nto get a kidney transplant when they make more money keeping them on the dialysis treatment? If someone gets a transplant,\nthat is a lost customer. - Unfortunately, it's an option that's being denied a lot of people because it's in the financial\ninterest of dialysis centers to keep someone in dialysis rather than quote, \"Losing\nthem to transplant.\" - Now, DaVita has paid\nlike a billion dollars in settlements and for\nsome of this behavior, including $350 million they had to pay after being sued by the US government for paying doctors to\ngo out to recruit people to come to their dialysis centers so that they could corner\nthe market in certain areas. They had to pay another $450 million because they were found billing\nthe government for medicine that they had received and just thrown out and charged the government anyway so that they could get reimbursed. All of this, once again,\nfurther draining the money that is allocated by our\ngovernment to help people in need. And finally, number six,\nthe last on our list, the one I'm deeming the most egregious because it has to do with children and not just any children, the most vulnerable\nchildren in our society, specifically children who have been removed from their family because of abuse, abandonment,\nor death, foster children. If a foster child loses a parent or is physically or mentally disabled, the federal government entitles them to around $700 a month\nto subsidize their lives. This is one that goes straight\nfrom the federal government, from the Social Security Fund,\nstraight to these children, or at least it should. But here comes the corporate\nmiddlemen once again. States will often hire corporate\nmiddlemen like Maximus, who is in fact a part of this, to look through the\ndatabases of foster children to identify which of those children qualify for this benefit, meaning which of these\nchildren have a dead parent or are physically or mentally disabled. And then to go through the\nprocess of diverting that money away from the children\nand into state coffers. The state says they're doing this to help supplement the foster\ncare program in their state to help boost their budget. But what feels very icky about this to me is that it creates, once again, a business opportunity\nfor a for-profit company who is incentivized to\nscour these databases looking for children who\nqualify for this benefit to divert the money away from\nthem and towards the state. And Maximus gets paid a fee to do this. They're incentivized to do this\nas a service for the state, to look through these databases and look for children who qualify. There's one NPR report from a while back that reports that the\ncorporate middleman Maximus, who we've talked about at length here and who I will probably get sued by, would get $1,600 per child that they found who qualified for this benefit. Remember, a child whose parents are dead or who has a physical or mental disability who's entitled to around $700 a month to supplement their very difficult life. If Maximus finds that child and diverts that money into state coffers, Maximus gets paid $1,600. That was in Alaska. Oh, but it's still going on. In 2018, Washington\nState worked with Maximus to get $6.89 million of\nfoster children's money. Wisconsin got $4.13 million\nfrom their foster children, thanks again to the services of Maximus. Illinois, $18.7 million\nfrom foster children. Illinois didn't work with\nMaximus in this case, but another similar corporate middleman called Diversified Services\nNetwork to do the same thing. None of these companies want to be known or spoken out loud. They just sort of operate as like a proxy for the government. They just, this is what they do. This money is being diverted from going directly to the foster children to going into the statewide\nfoster care program. So it still is benefiting\nthose children indirectly, but it feels wrong to me because this money was intended\nto benefit them directly. These are the most vulnerable\nchildren in our society. This money is entitled to go to them. (paper rustling) Okay, so that was kind of awful. I learned a lot about how\nthe welfare system works and what privatization means. I also learned that there are situations where this makes a lot of sense. I didn't go into the full evaluation of privatization versus not. I don't think that was\nthe scope of this video. What I've been trying to\ndo here is look at places where in our vast welfare system, profit-seeking corporations\nhave found ways to exploit that system to make money at the expense of vulnerable populations that are entitled to that money, who we, the taxpayer, pay to\nhelp supplement their life so that they can have a better life. Now, what can we do about this? Is this just totally hopeless? The answer is no. - How do we fix the situation? Well, you know, there's an old saying that the first rule of\nholes is to stop digging. And in this case, the first rule would be to stop privatization. The industry has kind of\ngrown under the radar, unchecked, unmonitored for decades now. And we don't know how big the problem is and we can't tackle it\nunless we get some sense of how much money is going to this, the amount of drag that the\ngovernment is experiencing from the poverty sector. And I think that's the first step, one of the first steps to take. - I believe that there's a version of privatized contractors\nadministering public services and welfare that is\nresponsible and actually works for serving the vulnerable\npopulations it's intended to. To do that, it will\nrequire much more oversight and regulation that takes into account all of these incentives, that treats corporations like adults who are going to find\nwhatever loophole they can in whatever system to make money and closes those loopholes. Also, if we're gonna\ncall this privatization, we need competition, real competition, not these near monopoly, massive companies that kind of own entire\nsectors of public spending. And in all of this, I\nthink we should reevaluate how much profit should play a role in these companies incentives. California is also\nworking on a profit cap, specifically for the dialysis centers, making it so that they\ndon't even have the ability to profit as much as they do. Now, unsurprisingly, this\nwas fought tooth and nail with over a hundred million\ndollars from dialysis centers and the Proposition 8 was shot down. But it's a great policy recommendation and it begs the question, how much profit should a corporation that is administering public\nwelfare be entitled to? But ultimately, none of this will change unless the customer demands more. And the customer in this\ncase is the government. If the government does not measure and demand better performance, these companies will not do better. The government seems to not be demanding a lot of change on the whole. There's a trend towards\nmore and more privatization in things like Medicaid\nand other benefits. Our belief in the market\nhas allowed us to be blind to some of these failures. And my worry is as we\ncontinue to privatize without plugging some of these gaps, without fixing some of these loopholes, we are enabling these companies\nto exploit those loopholes. And as we've seen, they will do it. They will find ways to continue\nto get rich off the poor. (pensive music)"}]}

There's a really important chart that shows this that I want to show you. (bright classical music continues) This chart shows all of the\ninterstate conflicts over time, at least since World War II. Interstate just means wars\nfought between two countries. You'll notice that it's\na pretty flat line. Some years, there's just\none or two conflicts, and some years, there's\nno conflicts at all between countries. But if you pay attention to the world, that doesn't seem right. (bomb explodes) (bright classical music continues) It certainly doesn't feel like\nthe world is mostly at peace. And that's because this\ngraph doesn't represent all the types of war that exist. For that, you have to stack on a different kind of war. Like this. This is civil\nwars or intrastate wars. You can see that there's\na lot more of those, but not as many as in the '90s. But now, I wanna show you\nwhat this graph looks like if we put on a different kind of war, the kind of war that\nwe're talking about today. It looks like this. (suspenseful piano music) What we're looking at\nhere is intrastate wars. So civil wars, wars within a country, but that are internationalized, meaning they have external backing. The more common name\nfor this is proxy wars. (suspenseful piano music continues) They used to be fairly rare, but look what's happened\nstarting 15 years ago. (suspenseful piano music continues) There were over 25 proxy wars\nhappening at one time in 2020. Now, these usually get\ntalked about as civil wars, the Rwandan Civil War,\nthe Syrian Civil War, the Civil War in Sudan. But these are not just civil wars, and that's what you can't really see by just looking at a graph. You have to go deeper which\nis what I wanna do today. I wanna show you how these things work and why they're so dangerous. Because this is the new way that the most powerful countries in the world fight each\nother, not fighting directly, but by using other conflicts\nas their battlefield. Proxy wars are deadlier,\nmore resistant to peace, and they're a driving force\nchanging geopolitics today. (suspenseful piano music continues) So I want to explain to\nyou what proxy wars are, how they work, why they're so deadly, and why they're on the rise. (suspenseful piano music continues) - [Jeremy] Hey, how are you? - Doing well, how are you doing? Thanks for taking the moment to chat. - [John] I've been\ntalking to Jeremy Shapiro about proxy wars. He's got a lot of perspective on this. - Worked in the US government on that, and so, there's some things\nthat I can maybe allude to, and I can't really talk\nabout how I know them, so don't ask for sources on\nthat one, (laughs) I guess. - Yeah, yeah. Okay, so before we get into\nproxy wars in our world today, I want to go into an imaginary world, a fake map that we've made up. (bright music) How would you concisely\ndefine what a proxy war is? - I think it is when a\nwar is instrumentalized by outside parties to use it as a proxy for their external or larger dispute. - In this made up world,\nthere are two dominant powers. Let's call them Johnny Land, and over here, you've got is Izistan. Yes, I'm doing this. Let's\njust go with it, please. In the old days, if Johnnyland\nand Izistan went to war, it would look like this. They would send their armies\nsmashing into one another. It was really violent. - It looked very much like\nWorld War I and World War II. They ended up in massive\nwars with each other that were quite destructive,\noften to their own countries, particularly if they lost. But frankly, even if they didn't lose. - Well, and let's remember\nwhy big powers go to war. And they do this to assert\ndominance over their region. Maybe they're after the same resources. Maybe they fear each other as rivals, and they see an opportunity\nto weaken the other. Or maybe, Johnnyland\nforgot to sign the kids up for little league and Izistan is angry. And they're fighting directly. This is how war has worked\nfor thousands of years. That is until the\ngreatest war of them all. (suspenseful piano music) (bomb exploding)\n(machine gun rattling) World War II was a war\nthat showed the world that we had become too\ndangerous, too advanced, too destructive, especially\nwith the invention of atomic weapons. (nuclear bomb exploding) - Nuclear weapons really focus the mind. They are so destructive and so easy to deploy once\nyou have them that the idea that you could ever defend\nyourself against that is not one that really any country\nhas ever entertained. In a nuclear age, it\nwould be insanity for them to fight each other directly. - So direct war between these two great\npowers became unthinkable and thus, it basically stopped. This is a crazy thing,\nlike sometimes we forget that like we live in a world where great powers don't\nfight each other directly, something that they've always done, but that doesn't mean they\ndon't fight each other.

Now, let's get back to our story on how countries fight each\nother in the modern age, (suspenseful piano music continues) - In the nature of countries, they're still extremely competitive and still looking for\nways to harm each other, to get leverage on each other, to sort of win in\ngeopolitical competition. - Great powers still see\neach other as a threat. They still crave dominance over their region and over the world. - Indirect ways of attacking each other, such as supporting proxies and civil wars has\nbecome much more popular since nuclear weapons were invented. (nuclear bomb explodes) (suspenseful piano music continues) - So back to our fake map, what this looks like is\nit would probably start as a conflict popping up\nwithin a nearby country, could be a civil war or power struggle, or just some political unrest. Now, these two big\ncountries see an opportunity to fight each other indirectly by supporting one side of this war. They send guns, money, military trainers, and this is a proxy war. (suspenseful piano music continues) The two sides fighting\nwithin the smaller country are the proxies or sometimes\nreferred to as clients, and the outside supporters\nare called patrons. Now, remember in this case,\nthey're just sending support to their side of an internal struggle, a civil war in another country. - [Jeremy] A war is instrumentalized by outside parties to use it as a proxy for their external or larger dispute. - From the great power perspective, what is the advantage or benefit of choosing this tool of engagement, rather than more direct versions? - Depending on the situation,\na great power can hope that they can really sap the strength of their rival through\nsupport to a proxy war. - Unfortunately, this is\na really rational thing for big countries to do. They get deniability. They can say, hey, we're not\nreally involved in this war, and they don't have to\nsacrifice any of their citizens, and they're able to contain the violence in someone else's country. They get to fight their rival and have someone else pay the price. - That's proven to be inefficient and somewhat from a\ngreat power perspective, less dangerous way of\ngeopolitical competition than direct wars. - Now, technically, proxy wars can take slightly different forms,\nlike if the two big countries support two smaller countries\nthat are fighting each other, or if one big country\ninvades another country and then the rival supports the\nresistance of that invasion. There's lots of different forms, but the whole idea is that\nthese two great powers are fighting each other\nvia a different country or different groups. (suspenseful piano music ends) Let's be done looking at the fake map and look at the real map, the real history of what proxy wars look like in real life. This dynamic has existed\nfor a really long time, but the modern version of it starts to really crop up in the Cold War. (suspenseful piano music continues) (rocket whooshing) (plane engine roaring) - [Air Traffic Controller] 116. - We've got these two great powers, the two big patrons, Soviet\nUnion and the United States, using proxy war as a\nway to fight each other, turning the entire globe\ninto a battlefield. This is why it was a Cold War. They never fought each other directly. They just chose local conflicts to support and fuel in an effort to win\nmore influence over the map. Right after World War II,\nthe superpowers focused on China's civil war\nsupplying opposite sides with military hardware, money, training. This paid off for Moscow\nwhen the communist side won. It was a major blow to the United States, but the support in this proxy\nwar was nothing compared to what happened right after in Korea. - [Reporter] Korea had become\na place of 24-hour terror, nothing and no one was left untouched by the harsh bitter reality of war. - Moscow authorized its\nproxies in the north to try to take over the US-backed south, something they wanted to do. And we made a whole video\nabout that relationship between Kim Il Sung and Joseph Stalin. The Soviets supported them\nwith guns, money, fighter jets, and the US, which already\nhad troops there sent more, way, way, way more like almost 2 million. The Soviets fought back by fueling the North Korean invasion. And then China, who\nremember, was supported by the Soviet Union, sent its\narmy to join the fight too, turning the Korean peninsula\ninto a battleground, not just between Koreans, but between these massive\npowers who were both trying to spread their ideology across the map. All of this outside weaponry and manpower prolongs the fighting beyond what the two sides\ncould sustain on their own. Compared to little North and South Korea, American, Chinese, and Soviet supplies were practically limitless, and this escalated the conflict for years. (suspenseful piano music) And then you see something crazy here, which is something we're gonna see a lot in these proxy wars. Even when North Korea\nwanted to stop the fighting, Moscow wouldn't let them. They told them to keep fighting. They had so much leverage over them that they continued to fight. Joseph Stalin, the Soviet leader, even knew his side couldn't win, but he directed them to keep fighting because he wanted to quote, \"Draw out the war to\nshake up the Truman regime in America and harm the military prestige of the Anglo-American troops.\" Sometimes that's the logic of a proxy war. Let an entire country burn just\nto embarrass your opponent. We actually saw a version of\nthis way back in the Civil War when Great Britain sent guns\nto the confederate rebels. But what happened in Korea\nwas on whole new level. It was so much more deadly. It turned this entire\npeninsula into scorched earth, all so that these great\npowers could play out their rivalry using Korea\nas their battleground. (suspenseful music) Okay, so you would think that\nafter the Korea situation, both sides would be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, that got really bad. Let's like rethink this. But instead, both sides\nenshrined proxy war in their wartime doctrine. (suspenseful music continues) The policy was to give\nmilitary support to any nation that was resisting Soviet\npolitical aggression, pledging military support. Now, of course, to the public, this was framed very\ndifferently than proxy war. - The free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedom. If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world. - A tremendous number of examples\nof this, where in essence, the intervention of the great\npowers ended up creating or defining the sides and\ninternationalizing the conflict or even creating the conflict. So some of these wars\nwere of indigenous origin, probably most of them, but some of them were actually\nstarted from the outside as weapons against each other. And others were sort of\ncombination of the two. - And this gets kind of crazy because what it does is it\nhijacks local conflicts, turning them into an existential conflict between the Soviet Union\nand the United States when the local conflict maybe\nhad nothing to do with that. Now, that incidentally\nalmost led to World War III and taught us that proxy wars\nnot only exacerbate conflicts and turn them into these\nhighly ideological things, but also if one side escalates, it can spiral to become really dangerous. (suspenseful music ends) Okay, let's speed things up here. 'cause we now have the basis\nfor what a proxy war is and sort of how it worked\nduring the Cold War. I'm gonna do a speed round now where I give you a few more examples. So you can pick up on the patterns of how cold war/proxy\nwars actually worked. (suspenseful violin music) In the 1960s, you had the newly independent\nand resource-rich Congo. The US supports the rebel\ngroups that are seeking to overthrow this Soviet-backed president. The country plunges into a civil war. And the great powers each\nsupport their own side, which ultimately leads to the installation of an American-friendly dictator. Vietnam, like the Vietnam\nWar that a lot of us are familiar with was a proxy war. The Soviet Union had\narmed and funded one side, and the US eventually\nsent millions of troops to prop up the other side, showing us the madness of proxy wars. The US would sacrifice\nso many of its citizens to prevent this one spot on\nthe map from turning red. And in the end, the\nUS-backed side lost anyway. Now, this wasn't the only proxy war that turned out to be fairly pointless. Look at Afghanistan in the late '70s. The Soviet Union was supporting their puppet government there\nand a rebellion broke out. The Soviets invaded to prop up their ally and then here comes the US because they both\nopposed the Soviet Union. The Mujahideen took all of\nthose weapons and money, and training and funding\nfrom the United States. They were their temporary ally. (suspenseful violin music continues) - What the US recognized\nquite early on in the war is that the Soviets had exposed themselves. They'd created a situation\nin which they needed to occupy a very difficult country and in which relatively inexpensive and easy provisions of arms and training to Afghan rebels,\nthe so-called, Mujahideen, could sap the strength in\na very disproportionate way of the Soviet army. And that was incredibly successful. - This totally worked and\nthe Soviets were driven out, the Soviet Union, collapsing\na few months later. (calm piano music) Okay, we're done with the Cold War 'cause I wanna get to modern day. I wanna explain this\ngraph why it's going up. If you wanna learn more about the Cold War proxy\ndynamics, et cetera, we made a video about all the\ncoups that the US sponsored during the Cold War and into modern day that goes deeper into some of these cases. But remember, the Cold War ended. This global competition between the two superpowers was over. So you would think that proxy wars, which is conflict fueled\nby two big patrons, would go down like they would be over. But the opposite is true. Proxy wars after the Cold War skyrocket, and Jeremy helped me understand why. (gun bangs) I notice a shift in the\nkind of flavor of proxy wars and how they look after the Cold War. How would you characterize\na proxy war in the '70s between with the Soviet\nUnion and the US feels and looks different than one\nhappening in the Middle East or you know, all around the world today? - There are many more players,\nI guess, is the issue. - So instead of just these\ntwo big patron powers, we now have so many more powerful and semi-powerful countries\nthat are sponsoring proxy wars, using them as a tool to gain influence and to damage their rivals. This means that more and\nmore conflicts looked like what Lebanon looked like\nin the '70s and '80s. A civil war that had so\nmany different factions and that had so many\noutside patrons sponsoring the different factions. And again, we made a whole video about the Lebanese civil war\nand the rise of Hezbollah. You can check that out. Now, remember back in the Korean War when Kim Il Sung wanted\nto negotiate a peace deal, but his patron wouldn't let him? In conflicts like this, like Lebanon, we have so many different patrons. You don't just have two big\npowers that can veto peace. You have like four or five. - It makes it last a lot longer. It makes it very, very\ndifficult to end them. This is in the one instance because it dramatically\ncomplicates the negotiation, but maybe even more fundamentally, it is because wars tend\nto end when one side or both can't fight them anymore. And the existence of these\nmultiple external supporters means that if one side gets\nsort of pushed to the very edge, there's an incentive for one\nor more external supporters to come in and sort of resurrect them, resurrect them at least enough to be able to continue the war. And this is the great\ntragedy of proxy wars, is that they have a sort\nof dynamic equilibrium to them where they can\nbe fought for decades because the external supporters can always do enough to continue the war, but rarely do enough to\nactually end the war. (calm piano music continues) - Okay, so that's our\nfirst major reason why this graph is going up. We live in a multipolar world. There's a lot more of these\npowers willing to be patrons. The other big reason is that proxy wars are\nbecoming increasingly cheap. (machine gun bangs)\n(calm suspenseful music) Back to the Congo. Now, we're in the late '90s, and you have a lot of rebel\ngroups that are fighting for influence, fighting for resources. This civil war became the battleground for neighboring nations\nto fight with each other, but indirectly using the\nCongo as their battlefield. Uganda and Rwanda sent money and weapons to rebel groups on one side and even invading to help them fight. Namibia, Angola, and Zimbabwe armed and funded the other side, each hoping to install\na friendly government. And when you're talking\nabout small rebel militias in the Congo, you don't have\nto do a lot to support them. Sending small arms, a\nlittle bit of training, some logistics support, that goes a long way in\ngiving them influence or in using them to support your troops that are there as well. And in this case, in particular, to add more complexity to it, supporting a certain group\ncould mean getting access to a resource-rich piece of\nland, which you can then exploit and kind of pay yourself back for the support you\ngave to those militias. All of this leading to one of the deadliest conflicts\nin modern history and showing us how these new\nkinds of proxy wars burn slowly and for a very long time\nand can be very destructive. They're really hard to\nstop once they start. (APC engine revving) (calm suspenseful music continues) Now, let's see how this plays out in Libya in more recent years. (calm mysterious music) 2011, the people rose up. They threw out their longtime\ndictator only to fracture and find themselves in a\npower vacuum and a civil war. And here come the patrons to choose which side they want to win. - [Jeremy] The Russians, the Turks, a couple of European\ncountries, the French, and the United States, and Egypt, all have various external roles. - [John] These patrons\nhave poured money, weapons, and even sending in airstrikes\nto support their side. - [Jeremy] And they're all quite important in sustaining that Civil War. - Libya is still divided between these foreign-backed groups. We often think of a\nrevolution that overthrows a dictator as like a really good thing because sometimes it leads to democracy, but because of these\nmodern proxy war dynamics, sometimes it can go the other way. What is dislodging a strong\nman, maybe create fertile soil for this sort of\ninternationalized civil war? - Well, typically, what\nhappens when you dislodge a strong man is that you don't have another one to replace him. Different groups are vying for power and vying to reestablish governance or even reestablish total control. One of their instincts is to go out and find external supporters who can add a tremendous amount of\ncapacity to their ability to fight those domestic struggles. You think about it for\nyourself, you're there, you're the Johnny Harris Liberation Front, and you are fighting the\nguy across town who has, you know, an up-and-coming video podcast. You're kind of evenly matched. If you can go and get some big money from HBO, you can crush him. But at that point, HBO owns you. If he then goes out and gets some money from Netflix, you guys can be fighting\nthese podcast wars for many decades. I hope that into language\nyou can understand. - Love the analogy.\n(Jeremy laughs) Which is how we got a horrific war. like the Syrian Civil War. (calm piano music) It started as an uprising\nto overthrow the dictator. It descended into a civil war eventually attracting powerful patrons that fueled a decade and a\nhalf of horrific bloodshed. (calm piano music continues) This is one of the deadliest\nproxy wars of our time. Not just because over a\nhalf a million people died. Because of what outside\nsupport did to fuel that, it escalated it year after year, leading the dictator to gas his own people and giving rise to violent\nextremists all while being fueled by patrons that seemingly\nhad endless supplies to keep fueling the fighting. (calm piano music continues) A similarly horrific thing is\nhappening in Sudan right now, a civil war that has\nbeen internationalized, which is making it way\nworse than it would've been had these patrons not gotten involved. (calm music) This is what modern proxy war looks like. It is longer, it is deadlier, and it is more resistant to peace, but there's one proxy war\nthat doesn't really fit with the model we've talked about here. (foreboding music) (Putin speaking in Russian) Let's talk about Ukraine.\nUkraine's kind of a weird one. How do you see Ukraine and\nthe proxy dynamics there? How do you think about\nwhat's going on there? - [Jeremy] It is hard. I mean, it's interesting\nthe US-Ukraine relationship is a sort of classic\nproxy war relationship. But on the other side of\nthe equation is Russia, which at the same time\nis the main combatant and feels like it's almost\nfighting a proxy war. - So you have Ukraine who was invaded and is being supported\nby the west to fight, but they're fighting\nagainst Russian troops, but also Russian-backed\nmilitias that are fighting to control territory in eastern Ukraine. - The Russians are very convinced that they're fighting the United States and the West and Ukraine. And so, I've come to\nthink of Ukraine as a sort of half proxy war, which\nis why it's so dangerous because, you know, one nuclear power is already deeply engaged and already deeply\nbelieves that the outcome of the war is of an\nexistential importance to them. But I think the Russian\nattitude that they have to win this war, that they're\ndeeply involved in this war, that they have sacrificed enormous amounts and that the very existence of their state and regime depends on it,\nmeans that the possibilities for escalation outside of a proxy war context are very severe. This is an important distinction. (foreboding music continues) - And Ukraine highlights something that we haven't really talked about yet and is very important here,\nwhich is the perspective of the people on the ground\nexperiencing the conflict. Why would they accept support\nfrom an outsider knowing that it will just make\nthis conflict more deadly? And you can see the answer\non our little map here. (calm piano music) People on this side of the battle line have been under Russian occupation that's massacred civilians. It's erased Ukrainian culture. It's kidnapped tens of thousands of Ukrainian children into Russia. So if you live on this side of the line, of course, you would take foreign help to reclaim your country,\nto push the invaders back. To you, this isn't a proxy war in all of its sterile language. This is a struggle for your survival, for your very existence. And that is often why local\ngroups will take support from the outsiders because they know their enemy's gonna do it, too, and they know that it's the\nonly way that they can survive. And this is the deadly\npsychology of a proxy war. (calm piano music ends) (mysterious music) Okay, now, we haven't talked about China. Like we've talked about the\nUnited States and Russia, and all these other patrons. Where's China in all of this? It turns out China doesn't\nplay the proxy game. Very surprisingly, this is not their style of geopolitics. As best we know, they haven't directly\nsupported Russia in their fight with Ukraine, though, of\ncourse, they do continue to support in shipping them\ntechnology and all these things, but not in the traditional proxy war way. Now, there's a few\nlikely reasons for this. Number one, Beijing likes stability and proxy wars are like\nthe opposite of stability. They're also very\ninterested in not bringing any kind of conflict into their borders. They want peace and\nstability in their borders. And then, and this is a\nreally interesting one, China has this foreign policy tenet, they call one of their golden rules, which is that they do not get involved or interfere in the internal\naffairs of other countries. This is like a pretty big value\nin Chinese foreign policy. It's one of the big critiques\nof the United States is that the US is always sort of meddling other people's countries trying to influence them this way or that. China's pretty strong about the idea that they will make trade deals, and they'll try to influence people with like sending them\nstuff and giving them debt. But this kind of like meddling\nin a civil war on a matter of principle, China stays\nout of it, at least for now. And this is kind of being tested right now on Chinese southern border. There's a civil war happening in Myanmar. A rational great power would\npick a side and support them, but China hasn't done this. Now, they have sent a war plane and are considering giving drones to one side of this conflict. So this may turn into a\nfull-blown proxy situation. But for now, it looks like\nChina's actually sticking mostly to its principle of trying\nto stay out of interfering with the affairs of another\ncountry in a very direct way, trying to prolong a conflict\nto weaken the other side. And honestly, it's hard not to wonder what could happen if China starts to play the proxy war game\nlike other big powers. This is a country with advanced weaponry and cyber capabilities\nand a global network of allies and connections. And with a world that already has so many patrons creating all of these cross-cutting geometries\nbetween different forces, I'm not sure we can handle China being another one of these patrons. Like what does that do to the system? So that is why this graph exists, why proxy wars are spreading. It is a fairly disastrous trend, especially for the people caught in the middle of wars that are fueled by outsiders paying the\nprice for a conflict that has nothing to do with them. So we need to pay attention to this. Proxy wars are the way\nthe world works now. It's the way great\npowers fight each other. And as international tensions heat up, we need to understand how\nto look for proxy wars, how to look at a conflict,\nnot just as a civil war, but look at who is supporting, who are the sponsors, who are the patrons? That's gonna become\nincreasingly important. We will certainly be covering\nthese different conflicts in different ways as they heat up.

(pensive music) - [Johnny] I'm standing\non a giant map at CNA, getting ready to play a game about war. (pensive music continues) - [Participant] In Taiwan, a delicate piece looks\na little more fragile. - Today, I'll be assuming the\nrole of the leader of China. I am presumably the leader\nof the PRC right now. - Yeah.\n- Okay, amazing. And Sam, the creator of our channel Search\nParty, is playing the leader of the United States. I, China, have just invaded\nTaiwan and I have troops there. It's been 90 days and now Sam has to decide\nwhether to respond and how. But wait, what's going on here? We're surrounded by experts\nin all kinds of fields having to do with war. And we're at an organization\nthat does research and analysis for the US\nmilitary, but we're rolling dice. We're playing on a giant game board. (pensive music continues) Why do we need to play games about war? - War games are a very cheap way to get better at decisions than war. - [Johnny] Militaries\nspend millions of dollars on designing and playing war games, and I came here to understand why. (compelling music) Here's the US military gaming\nout World War II battles before they happened. Here's the Vietnam War, the Iraq War, and lately they've been gaming out what might happen if China invades Taiwan. That's what we're doing today. Now this has always struck me as odd that we play games for war. So I asked CNA if I could come do one for myself to see what I could learn. So let's see how this face-off\ngoes using this giant map, and in the process we'll learn\nwhy militaries play games. (compelling music continues) (bomb explodes) Okay, so here's how it works.\n(suspenseful music) The game designers have created a scenario where I, China, have invaded Taiwan. - [Adjudicator] For 90 days, we have had boots on the ground in Taiwan. - [Johnny] And all these\nblocks represent the weapons, the vessels, and troops that\nI have in my theater of war. The game designers have\ngiven both Sam and me specific objectives that reflect real world objectives\nin a conflict like this. And that's about it. It's now on us to make decisions as if we were the leaders\nof our respective sides and see how the other side reacts. (suspenseful music continues) While Sam is consulting with\nhis advisors on the first move, I start thinking about the\ncountries in this region. How do I use this moment to\nundermine confidence in the US to make the US look less trustworthy? Right away I'm feeling like\nI have the upper hand here. I've captured Taiwan, and now all I need to do\nis keep the US military and it's allies away. I want to make it really costly for the US where any calculation they have to make comes with a very high\ncost to American citizens. We've just begun this game and I'm already surprised at\nhow into this I'm getting, I can feel Sam's anger at\nme that I invaded Taiwan. My worry that he'll respond\nand escalate this conflict. So I start working on a\nplan to make it difficult and costly for him to respond, hopefully keeping him out of here. We head to the map to\nstart looking at options. I toy around with creating a\nblockade around the island. We have the advantage of proximity and speed to set up a wall that says this is gonna be costly. But this is where I start\nthinking about the US' presence in the region,\nespecially in Japan and Korea. There's a huge presence here.\nIs this a vulnerability? I think the scariest\nthing is just the movement across the strait is\nprobably where they're going to focus in. And it's like, can I stop that? So I'm trying to think\nof these contingencies, what they might do. Okay, I'm about to take\nmy turn, but I wanna pause to thank today's sponsor, incogni, for sponsoring today's video. All of our personal\ninformation is really valuable and companies buy and sell it so that they can target us for a variety of things. Advertisements, insurance premiums.

They do the hard work of\nrestoring your privacy. And my favorite part is\nyou get to check in on it. They've got this dashboard. So to date, they've\ntaken me off of 657 lists and they've successfully taken\nme off of 533 of those lists and they estimate that they've\nsaved me almost 400 hours. They're giving 60% off to all of you. If you use the link in my description, it's incogni.com/johnnyharris, you get 60% off the yearly plan. Thanks incogni for\nsponsoring today's video. I know all of you are excited\nto get back to the giant map to see what move I make\nin the South China Sea. Let's do it. Now, I've studied the geopolitics of this region extensively, but already I feel myself\nlooking at this region in a whole new way. So my plan is to beef up my naval presence around Taiwan while also moving more of my troops onto the island, hoping that Sam doesn't attack. Great. I think we have a plan here. And I guess I'll wait\nto see what blue does. Over on team blue, Sam seems to be\ncontemplating punishing me, not with a direct strike, but by targeting my natural resources. - I think oil is probably a move. - [Johnny] Okay, we've done our planning. It's time for us to both make our moves. - So both of you have two operations prioritized, ready to go. (suspenseful music) - What we are interested in\nis consolidating our control over this island and signaling to the rest of the region and to anyone else who\nmight wanna get involved that we're really serious about defending. And so we are going to move\nsome of these naval assets to surround the island. As I make my move, the surreal experience of feeling like the leader\nof China continues to grow. We are not here to kick anyone out or to invade other places. We are simply here to realize\nour role in the region as the leader of the region. And this is our way of demonstrating that and we hope it does not escalate into anything more than it needs to. (personnel speaking in foreign language) Okay, here comes the response from the US. - China did an act of aggression. We are basically going to show them the ramifications of that. We would like to choke\ntheir natural resources from the Indian Ocean. - [Johnny] The US military\nbegins stopping ships that are bringing oil to China. This is their punishment\nfor my invasion of Taiwan. And this is when I realize that\nwhat matters here isn't just how I respond to this, but what narrative I tell\nthe rest of the world that gets them on my side. Storytelling is so important\nin a war like this. There's no international\nlegal basis for this behavior. The US is a lawless, hypocritical state that bullies its adversaries. - But what we're trying\nto do here is to show them that they've made an error and that we have multiple\nways to punish them. - [Johnny] I'm kind of riffing here, but soon I find my narrative and I start to hit it hard. We are messaging to the world\nthat this kind of behavior of bullying our commercial ships and our energy resources is threatening the whole global economy. I decide to move some navy ships over to this important choke\npoint in the global economy near the Suez Canal, Djibouti, where China has a base, from\nwhich I can monitor the flow of goods and resources to my region. We will move a ship over to Djibouti here. It's not intervening in any way, it's just here in case things\nget a little more real. - I'm particularly interested in what do the countries also\nin the South China Sea and in East Asia feel? They're worried that China is expansionist and they much prefer the US to continue to be the one policing free\ntrade in this area than have China suddenly play that role. - [Johnny] We roll the dice to determine how other countries in\nthe region are reacting to all of this. - That's two, that's two.\n- Yeah. - So, it's tied.\n- Yep. - [Johnny] The tie means\nthat we adopt the assumption that the neighboring countries are split. The game adjudicator,\nwho's kind of the referee, helps move things along\nin a realistic way. - Yeah, there's an active debate in the Southeast Asia region over who is the right\nguarantor of their safety. - [Johnny] Tensions are rising here as we go back to our advisors to plot the next move. And while we do that, let me\nbriefly get you up to speed on why we're doing this\nin the first place. Turns out that playing games about war has been around for while. (compelling music) As long as there has been war and solid maps, military leaders have\nwanted to try to simulate how a war could play\nout before it happens. - People have been playing\ngames about war for thousands of years, and it's not about a game. It's about having an opportunity\nto think about things outside of actually having to do it. - [Johnny] But it wasn't\nuntil the early 1800s that war gaming became more formalized. A serious tool for war training and planning, real\nassumptions, real constraints, real game mechanics that mimicked at least\nsome aspects of real war. These Prussian dudes are not playing Risk. They're getting ready for war. There's a lot going on here. But the main point in these games is to present decision makers\nwith scenarios that force them to grapple with the hard decisions of war. World War II saw extensive gaming, so much so that one admiral later said that they had gamed out so many different scenarios\nof how the conflict with Japan could go, that quote, \"Nothing that happened during the war was a surprise. Absolutely nothing, except\nthe kamikaze tactics towards the end of the war. We had not visualized those.\" War games are practice for war. With time, these war games\nturned into huge productions involving hundreds or even\nthousands of participants. They moved on to fancy\ncomputer simulations that made it feel more and more\nreal, more and more precise. Some of the games were there to help plan for what might happen in war, but many other games were\nthere to help hone the skills of different officers, to train them. (compelling music continues) Back on the giant map,\n(pensive music) the conflict is taking a new turn. Sam has sent a secret\noperation of American soldiers to covertly sabotage the bomber planes that I had sent to Djibouti. This will require a lot more maintenance and reduce their usefulness in the region. He's also moving a bunch of military assets into this region. I don't like it. - We are stepping up our\nNavy military assets, but out of range of China's defenses. - Brought forces.\n- Yes. (pensive music continues) - So we have total control of Taiwan. We've built this big naval\nblockade around the island. They are sabotaging our natural resources coming from the Middle East. And we China are using\nthis as a way to amplify to the world that the\nUS is a lawless bully who is sabotaging us when we're just doing what we're entitled to do. So it's looking pretty\ngood for the PRC today and not looking great for the US. I'm still feeling really\ngood about all of this. That is until Sam makes his next move. Looks like the US is going to\nescalate here by taking some of their ships through the Taiwan Strait, floating through the\nTaiwan Strait to assert that this is international water. They have the right to do this. Gonna come through the strait and show us that they're really serious\nabout defending Taiwan. This is a very risky escalatory move. Sam's naval ships will be\naccompanied by Japanese and Filipino ships. A show of solidarity with\nregional allies. This is not good. I go from feeling great to worried on how I'm going to respond. We can't let them do this because it completely\nshatters our whole narrative and our messaging. - This FON Operation is coming from Japan. It is escorting\nhumanitarian aid to Taiwan. It's been 120 days. They're starving. It's humanitarian aid. That's it. (compelling music) - I think we have to draw the red line and say, if you don't\nturn back, we are going to sink something. We're not bluffing, and I want to show that if your humanitarian\nship is coming escorted by military vessels, that will be an aggressive\nmove that we will respond to. - We don't recognize\nyour zone around Taiwan. So we are doing that anyway. - We continue our same message that anyone coming into\nthis water for any reason with military vessels is\nconsidered with hostile intent and will be treated as such. And we're not bluffing. - Our next moment of action\nis you're approaching this line of folks. - We bring out a line of ships to physically stop the movement. - I mean we'll continue to try and avoid, but we're navigating past. - I'm sure there's somebody\non a Chinese vessel that's got a very good video of a maritime militia\nship getting ram to stern. - This is a hostile act\nand very aggressive. And we are making plans to respond. And we ask you to turn around immediately or you'll face the consequences\nof this invasive act that we have very clearly\nsignaled to you is not okay. - [Johnny] Sam is trying to call my bluff and I really don't want it to work. I can't let this happen. I have to respond or else all my threats will lose their credibility. And if you can't tell,\nI'm now fully immersed in being the leader of China. (suspenseful music) We have tried to avoid this very moment, but you have given us no choice. So I decide to use a series\nof missiles to target one of the Filipino ships. (dramatic music) We are firing at one vessel,\nattempting to sink it as a way to demonstrate our earnestness. So one way or another, we\noverwhelm your defenses and we get some missiles through, we sink the Filipino ship. Because of the chaotic\nnature of kinetic war, we roll some dice to establish whether or not in this scuffle, one\nof these ships fires back and shoots down one of my aircraft. And it turns out they do. So US takes down one of our jets. - A Filipino ship either\nhas been suck or is sinking. - The US SAG has fired back. (suspenseful music) There's a big flaming ship\nthat is clearly in the process of sinking in the middle of the strait. Lots of cameras going onto\nthe national newscasts showing these sinking ships. A shooting war has\nbegun. What happens next? - [Johnny] Sam acts\nquickly and retaliates, targeting one of my surface action groups, which looks something like this, sitting here in the Indian ocean. Things are escalating. - [Adjudicator] Our\nESG in the Indian Ocean sinks one of their SAGs. - Whoa.\n- About to have an engagement unprecedented\nin modern history. - Yeah.\n- The question becomes, what results from this, right? Is there enough US force to be able to defeat this? - If you're trying to do it, absolutely. My heart is actually beating faster. At this point, we're a couple hours into this and I find myself having forgotten that I am indeed not Xi Jinping and that I'm in an office\nbuilding in Arlington, Virginia, playing a game. I don't wanna escalate here. I think doing some sort\nof superficial damage kind of to this ESG would\nbe kind of a reasonable way to just say like, Hey, we will, you know, we will be here if you attack us. And this is where I really start to understand the value of all of this. This kind of role playing\nagainst a real human opponent in a real world scenario, forces you into a totally\ndifferent mental experience than reading about it, learning about it, watching movies about\nit, totally different, which is the whole point. And what I've shown you here\nis actually just the highlights of what was nearly a full day\nof playing out this scenario. We went into way more detail\non every one of these moves, forcing us to think about details and calculations, which\nreally couldn't have come in any other way. (dramatic music) - There is so much learning\nthat takes place on both sides. The red team players learn\nabout blue capabilities. The blue team players learn\nabout red capabilities. We want them to put\nthemselves in the head space of the commanding officer,\nthe person who would be making as many of those decisions as possible and think about what\ninformation they would have, think about what information\nthey wouldn't have. - The game is a framing mechanism. Each game that we design is\ntargeting a different series of cognitive processes to\ntry to help the players walk through, how would I solve this problem? Or how would I approach this issue? - [Johnny] Okay, so we\nplay games about war to prepare for war, some simple and physical\nthat can be done in a day, some digital built off\nsoftware that take weeks. But what do we do with the results? - What a war game allows\nyou to do is a very flexible approach to try to explore that\nand then set up things to go analyze and things to go and test and do. - [Johnny] Back in the 1960s, the US military extensively gamed out what would happen if they\njoined the war in Vietnam. When they tested gradually\nbombing North Vietnam with air attacks, the conflict\nonly escalated in the game, creating a prolonged conflict. In the game, the American public came out\nin opposition of this attack and the Communists gained\nsupport in the north. This all happened before the invasion, but the results were largely ignored, the assumptions questioned. And yet when we ended\nup going into Vietnam, quote, \"The outcome of this game was eerily prophetic of\nwhat actually happened.\" In 1999, the US military gamed out\nwhat it would look like to overthrow Saddam Hussein. They gamed out assassination,\nan internal coup. They gamed out what it would look like to handle infighting in the Iraqi army and even installing their own government. Every one of these resulted\nin some kind of chaos, ethnic conflict, military\ninfighting, the breakup of the country, mass\nviolence, rival forces bidding for power, concluding that\nthis would create quote, \"A period of widespread bloodshed and might lead to the creation of a less than desirable\npost-Saddam state.\" But a few years later,\nthere was a new president in the White House and\nhe was leading a country that had just been attacked by terrorists based in Afghanistan. But George Bush and the people around him were still obsessed with overthrowing Saddam\nHussein, a country away in Iraq. So they designed the most\nexpensive game in US history, a war game that simulated a\nwar with a made up country. But the Secretary of\nDefense wanted a report on how the learnings from\nthis game could be applied to a potential invasion of Iraq. The US side immediately lost the game when the red team used a\nbunch of low tech tactics to get ahead, sinking an American ship. The adjudicator stopped the game to reset it, refloating the ship and saying that such low tech\ntactics would never really work against the US in a real war. New constraints were put on the red team, and critics say that these\nnew constraints effectively guaranteed that the US would win. Now, the adjudicators could\nhave had other reasonings for resetting the game like this. But in the end, this represented yet another forced validation that the administration\nwas seeking to invade Iraq. (weapons exploding)\n(dramatic music continues) So war games can be very\ninformative, if those designing and playing those games are committed to learning from the game and not trying to get the\noutcome that they want. Something John Kirby emphasized to me a while back when we were setting up for an interview in the White House. - We're only as good as the input. And the honest way in\nwhich you execute 'em. - [Johnny] Back here on the game board, things continue to escalate, but we're out of time for today. Spending the day playing\nXi Jinping taught me a lot, a unique form of learning that helped me understand the geopolitics of the Pacific in a new way. So I'm walking away from\nthis with a much deeper understanding of why militaries put so much effort into making these games. I just got a little taste of it. Me and Sam are by no means good at this, but I can see how this\nserves as practice as a way of testing assumptions,\nthinking in new ways, something that is so important for something that is so high stakes. War is chaotic, it's emotional, it's reliant on humans\nmaking human decisions, and it's impossible to\nrealistically practice. And as always, when we talk about war, there's a deep paradox here, one that military thinkers have been repeating for centuries. that if you want peace,\nyou must prepare for war. - So war is a common factor of history. And it's better to think\nabout war than to fight a war. And maybe if we think about\nwar enough, we can figure out how to not fight a war. (dramatic music continues, concludes)"}]}

Yes. Speeches are so important that they make a person a vizier or a disgrace. Pay attention to those around you, people who speak well and use body language well, even if their qualifications are lower than you, can take a step forward. So, don't you want to step forward? In this video, you will find important conclusions about “How One Should Speak”. Our reference book “How to Talk to Anyone”... Conversations are links. When you talk to someone, you actually form a bond with the other person. After that, this bond gets stronger or weaker depending on the course of the conversation. We all meet many people we don't know every day. The woman in the market, the man in the taxi, the attendant at the hotel… We form new bonds with every conversation. Conversations are present in every moment of our lives. A speech can inspire you and change your life, a speech can tire you out of your life. Speeches can cause wars, speeches can establish peace. Ultimately, conversations define who we really are. Every single person in your life was a stranger to you. Until he gave the first speech. You didn't know anything about them. But then, when conversations came into existence, your friends or enemies began to exist. If you don't plan on living in seclusion and living in a cave, you have to TALK. So let's take a look at some simple but effective principles. Let's not kid ourselves: first impressions really matter. When you meet someone for the first time, the way you look and behave is etched in their brain and will undoubtedly affect any future relationship you have with that person. The first thing someone sees is your face, so a good first impression starts here. A smile makes a big difference in winning someone over. But people can spot a fake smile, so let your smile grow slowly. In this way, it will be possible to look more personal and real. Studies show that a natural-looking smile is even more important among women . In corporate settings, women who are slower to smile are considered more believable. Another tip is to avoid giving everyone in a group the same smile, as that can be repulsive. Try to change your smile when dealing with different people. Your eyes are also an important asset for winning people over – constant eye contact has been proven to help you gain both respect and love. If you want to improve a relationship, make eye contact with that person, even if they're not talking, and only break that contact when necessary. Now that we've got your face figured out, let's move on to body language, which has a strong influence on how you're perceived by others. It's important to know that just because someone is a stranger doesn't mean you have to treat them like a stranger . Instead, when greeting someone for the first time, treat them as if they were an old friend. Along with a warm smile, turn your body completely towards him so he can see that you're giving him your full attention. Also, if you fidget too much, the other person may feel uncomfortable. For this, you need to keep your hand movements under control. It may sound strange, but research shows that touching your face while talking makes you look less convincing. So stay calm and keep your hands away from your face. People tend to like people with whom they have common characteristics. Therefore, emphasize what you have in common. As they say, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. So use this to make it easier for you to get along with others. Of course, I'm not saying be a flatterer. How do they move? Slow and careful, or nervous and timid? When you mirror someone's actions, they will tend to feel more comfortable around you, even if they don't know exactly why. The same goes for language, so try to use the words and expressions they use. For example, if you're talking to someone who says they work for an ad agency, make sure they don't say company or firm, and you do the same. You can take this a step further by using terms related to interests. Another way to build intimacy is to drop \"uh huh, huh\" and use empathetic words instead. When we speak, we tend to subconsciously respond with mutterings such as \"exactly\", \"huh\" or \"it doesn't matter\" to show that we're just listening . But if you want to make a good impression, use full sentences that show your interlocutor that you're really listening , such as \"It was the right thing to do\" or \" I understand why you did it\". This will help them see that you truly understand the other person. Another issue is using the \"we\" language. For example, \"What do you think about inflation?\" instead of saying, \"How are we going to deal with this inflation?\" try saying. Finally, improve your humor. A deeper bond is formed when you have a shared laugh about something. You may think petty talk is trivial and a waste of time, but this is absolutely wrong. In your business and private life, petty talk can lead you to win rather than scare that person away. If your small-talk skills are lacking, try to prepare for the inevitable questions that will be asked of you. What questions do you always think of when trying to get to know someone? Possibly \"Where are you from?\" or \"What do you do?\" Because they are so cliché, these questions will often lead to boring answers. Therefore, instead of giving one-word answers to these questions such as \"Yozgat\" and \"Marketing\", be ready to elaborate. Streamline the conversation with an interesting fact or anecdote that opens the door to another topic . For example, if your hometown is Sinop, you can mention it here. You can talk about where the Greek philosopher Diogenes was born or why it is always chosen as the happiest city . In this way, a love beyond “Who are you from?” takes place. Another winning tip is to focus on being a good listener and knowing how to get the other person talking. It may seem counterintuitive, but one of the best ways to get people to think you're a great speaker is to say very little and keep their attention. So the more you get the other person to talk and ask questions about their interests, they won't even notice that you don't talk much and they will think how nice conversation you are. is to repeat. It's also perfectly possible to keep someone talking, leading them to all sorts of interesting revelations . Of course, this choice is up to you. An easy way to earn some chat compliments is to know who has a great story in the group, and then give a flattering introduction for that person. Of course, in his decision. This not only provides entertainment to the group. Also, the person with the story will most likely appreciate that you give them the opportunity to shine. So one stone, two birds. Just make sure the story is appropriate and not something that is told to you in secrecy . When you talk, you should also avoid saying things that will make you look bad. As people get to know each other better, they often feel the urge to admit something personal or reveal a weakness. This is an error. If the other person isn't too impressed with you already, revealing a secret will likely make them wonder what else you've been hiding. Praise is a good thing, isn't it? In theory it is, but in practice, it can be harmful if the other person thinks you're being insincere. Therefore, it would be wise to give praise indirectly. One way to do this is to convey nice words through a common acquaintance. The delivery of good news by a third party often has a greater impact on the person . Most people think they are doing good things that go unnoticed. You can brighten someone's day by simply telling them they did a good job! Remember that it's even better when the praise is done instantly. Instead of waiting a week to give praise, speak up immediately when good behavior occurs . Because public speaking is difficult for most people, instant praise can be especially good when someone makes a new presentation . If you tell your colleague right away that he did a good job, he will appreciate it. For those closest and dearest to you, you can be specific in your compliments. If you want to give a dazzling compliment to that special person in your life, highlight a particular trait you truly admire. Maybe it's her stylish looks, incredible tenacity, or sheer charm. If you are sincere and sincere in your compliment, you can be sure that they will appreciate it. A simple but important point in dealing with people. Be more thoughtful. First of all, people need to pour out from time to time, especially after a hard day's work . Be patient, let them complain and spill their guts. Try to show that you are understanding. This will help them calm down, and when that happens, you can shift the conversation to whatever's on your mind. Second, make sure you don't put a conversation on hold. Let's say your friend is in the middle of a great story and a waiter interrupts her to take your orders. Remember to return to your friend after the distraction is gone and have them pick up where they left off. But sometimes things are best left unsaid. Sometimes there are moments that should go unnoticed. For example, when something embarrassing happens when you are around someone else. The most thoughtful thing to do is to continue the conversation as if it never happened. Rest assured, your friend will be very grateful for it. The final form of thoughtful behavior is to perfect the art of kindness. When you do someone a favor, you feel good. But if someone asks you to drop everything and do him a favor right now, then it's a different story. An unpleasant situation arises. So you shouldn't make the same mistake. Similarly, if you do someone a favor, don't immediately ask for something in return. Instead, let time pass so they know you're doing your favors for friendship. Maybe then you can say what you want. Of course, this is not in return for the good you did on time. But here's the truth: most of us keep a tally of some aspect of the good we do. Don't forget to thank those who watch your back for this. Let them know that you notice their well-being. If you're an ambitious employee, you probably want to impress your boss and advance your career. An important tactic for this is to make sure you always look professional. First, when talking to your boss, get straight to the point and speak directly. Important people don't have time to dance around the topic. When considering how to deliver the news, consider what the other person's reaction might be . Try to anticipate this. For example, if you think they'll be happy when they hear the news, convey it with a smile. If it's disappointing news, say it with a sigh. Also, remember that professionals do not make fun of, embarrass, or make jokes against other people. It would be wise to make a little preparation before an important meeting or interview . First, make sure you always have something right to say. Studies show that people with a large vocabulary are seen as more intelligent . Therefore, if you have repetitive words, try to use synonyms. Even get some spare words you can use. Think of it this way: you choose a new word once a day for two months and use them. If you try to use it in your speeches, you will see how the perception towards you changes in a positive way. Having some relevant quotes on hand is another good technique. When you come across a good quote, write it down and memorize it. When you find a suitable opportunity and use this quote, it will have an incredible impact. I will never forget that an administrator had a tremendous impact on the people present when, at the very beginning of his speech, at an important meeting during the pandemic, Stalin said, \"The death of one person is a tragedy, the death of 10 people is dramatic, and the death of 1 million people is statistics\". It's helpful if you're focused. Talk to yourself first if needed. But before you meet someone for the first time when no one is around , you may have anxious thoughts like, \"What if we don't have anything in common?\" or \"What are we going to talk about? \" You'll find that all it takes is a soft introduction. One of the classic techniques for getting others to talk to you is to have something that melts the ice, like an old pocket watch or one-of-a-kind item you can bring with you. That's when someone asks , \"Where did you get this?\" It opens the door for you.And you see that you are chatting like best friends. If you're the host, you can make things easier by introducing them and adding one or two interesting facts about each person. That way, everyone has a chance to ask a follow-up question and get the ball rolling. After the meeting has taken place and the conversation has begun, focus your attention on the person's behavior. No one wants to be stuck in a conversation where someone is telling a boring and seemingly endless story . So pay close attention to how they talk and respond to make sure you don't let this happen to other people. Try to match their mood and tone of voice; everyone will be more likely to be attentive and interested. For example, if they are smiling and have an active body language, do the same. Or if the environment is gloomy and people are sitting back in their chairs, do your best to fit in. It is important to have a strong introduction to a medium. Sometimes you have to be ambitious. Remember, first impression is very important. Before you go in, stand at the door and scan the room. After viewing the place, you can smile and step inside. This kind of dramatic entrance is sure to impress those present. Once inside you must take the initiative and head for the most interesting person without being too pushy. Take care of your hands; Avoid actions that could be subconsciously perceived as a threat, such as pointing the index finger . Instead, adopt an open and inviting stance with your palms facing out. Don't forget to listen and make a mental note of what the other person has said, as these will be helpful for you to use later. What you'll note includes personal details and anything else that seems important to them . Bringing up one of these details at your next meeting is sure to make a great impression. Finally, the essence of everything is a little awareness. When you put some techniques on it, you are likely to make a significant difference in your life. The answer to the question that I mentioned at the beginning of the video, how is it possible for some of them to stand out so much when they do not have much qualifications, actually lies in the techniques mentioned here. Final advice from the book in summary Visualize good habits. Before entering a community, imagine yourself smiling, making eye contact and practicing positive body language. The visualization can work as a self-fulfilling prophecy and will help your meeting go well. Remember valuable information that people reveal about themselves. As soon as you finish talking to a person, you can jot down interesting information on the back of their business card, for example. Then talk about a personal detail or two the next time you meet. You can influence them. In other words, try to show people that they are valuable, that you hear them, that you feel them. That's when the flowers bloom. The last word is from Mevlana; “Raise your words, not your voice. It is the rain that makes the flowers grow, not the thunder.”"}]}

And exactly how many hours of sleep do we need? So, is sleep a waste of time? We are currently in the autumn months. The feeling this season makes me generally feel is sadness. Sometimes, when not being able to wake up in the morning is added to this sadness, it becomes even more inextricable. Most of us have experienced a similar situation. We have a bad night's sleep and yawn involuntarily throughout the day. We cannot focus on our work and wander around throughout the day like zombies. We dream of the moment when we can go back to bed, but as soon as our heads hit the pillow, our eyes suddenly open. However, we had been longing for this sleep throughout the day. This is truly a nightmare. There are some people who cannot get enough sleep. If it's dark when you wake up in the morning, especially if there's traffic, it literally becomes torture. But it doesn't all have to be this way. Yes, as you can understand, our topic is sleep. How will we get better quality sleep and thus be able to wake up refreshed early in the morning? It is a subject that will increase your quality of life and even your level of happiness. In a way, sleep is actually the elixir of youth. We have to get quality sleep to repair our body and renew our mind. Even though the modern world, screens and artificial lights have begun to destroy the sanctity of sleep, the place we will turn to to counter this is modern science. Our reference book is Sleep Smarter…So Sleep Smarter. Of course, we will not just stick to this book. We will try to enrich it with some research. I thought this content would be useful, especially right now, to improve my quality of life . That's why I recommend you watch or listen until the end. Because “You can now listen to Baykalem videos as podcasts on YouTube Music.” X We will look at the basics of sleep science and their relationship with our physiology. It will be possible to stay early and vigorous when you learn some practical and biology-supported tips to fall asleep faster and sleep deeper . Sleepless nights! The first misconception is: Is sleep a waste of time? Frankly, most of the time I saw sleep as a waste of time. Maybe it was a little bit of a feeling of catching up with time. However, when I learned about the damages that could occur in the long term, I realized that I had to be careful. Our modern world rewards the fast and the productive. Therefore, sleep is often seen as a waste of time. When we are overwhelmed with work or overwhelmed by a series of tasks, the first thing we sacrifice is our sleep. This war on rest has become so fierce that the average person's sleep hours have dropped from about nine hours to seven. As far as I have researched separately from the book, although an average of 7-8 hours of sleep is recommended for adults, sleep duration is a process that varies from person to person. If sleeping conditions are not favorable, even 7 hours may be short. Of course, the opposite is also true. So, while some people need 8 hours, some may even need 6 hours. Here, it is more important how many hours of quality sleep you get, rather than how many hours you sleep. At this point, we should not get hung up on numbers. Because this becomes an obsession for some. So much so that it causes a condition that some call orthosomnia. Don't be constantly preoccupied with the need to achieve perfect sleep. This ironically causes more sleep problems. Of course, this is an extreme example. Questions to ask about finding the ideal time are: *Do I feel reasonably well-rested throughout the day? *Do I generally sleep undisturbed throughout the night? *Or if I wake up, can I fall back asleep easily? If your answer is yes to these, you do not need to worry too much about sleep. Let's state this first. Let's get back to the topic. There are big problems with painting sleep as the enemy of productivity. When you're sleep deprived, not only are you slower and less creative, you also accomplish less. Surgeons who stayed awake for more than 24 hours finished their tasks up to 14 percent later , according to a study published in the medical journal The Lancet . It has been determined that they make 20 percent more mistakes in the work they complete. So, before having surgery, it is useful to ask your doctor whether you sleep well at night. Insomnia reduces the glucose content of the brain. When this glucose decreases, the ones most affected are your parietal lobe and prefrontal cortex, which are involved in problem solving and higher-level thinking. After 24 hours without sleep, glucose in these areas decreases by 12 to 14 percent. What's more, many studies have shown that not even one night of rest makes us as insulin resistant as type-2 diabetics . Insufficient amounts of this essential hormone directly lead to weight gain, signs of aging and decreased sex drive. So sleep is not the enemy of productivity or an obstacle to be overcome . Sleep is a process that is vital for our physical and psychological health. Without quality sleep, we cannot be healthy and work at peak performance. This is partly because being awake is catabolic and sleep is anabolic. Catabolism occurs when molecules oxidize and combine with oxygen, causing them to break down. Anabolism is the opposite: it creates molecules from smaller units. It literally builds us. So, while we sleep, our body repairs itself. Fights signs of aging. It strengthens our immune, muscular and skeletal systems. Yes, this part is very important. Because we first need to understand the value of a night's sleep and that reducing sleep in the name of productivity will be counterproductive. You actually work productively during the day when you sleep well, not when you sleep little. You can be sure that 1 hour of sleep will be more productive than 2 hours without sleep. So what do we need to do to improve the quality of your Zs? The answer is in the next title… Should One Sleep in the Lights? First we need to understand this melatonin. This is a hormone produced by the pineal gland of our brain. It has rejuvenating and antioxidant properties. But most importantly, it regulates the body's circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythm is our internal body clock that tells us when to sleep. That is our biological clock. Our melatonin production is greatly affected by light exposure; When the sun sets in the evening, our body naturally secretes this hormone and makes us sleepy. People exposed to light early in the morning produce more melatonin in the evening. This allows them to fall asleep faster and deeper. Therefore, we should try to maximize light exposure during the day. Exposure to sunlight early in the morning is important because bright light encourages our brain, organs, and glands to stimulate and be alert. With this in mind, it's a good idea to take a short walk between 6:00 and 8:30 in the morning . To complete the sleep circle, it is necessary to limit your exposure to screens in the evening, starting 60 minutes before bedtime . Electronic devices emit an intense spectrum of blue artificial light. Your body is sensitive to this spectrum, and exposure to it in the evening inhibits the release of melatonin, making it difficult to sleep. There are software or glasses that filter this blue spectrum for phones and computers . But it's better all around to stay away from screens altogether and read a book before bed instead . Also, make sure you sleep in a pitch black room. Light is absorbed not only through our eyes but also through our skin. Night lights and daylight leaking through curtains inhibit melatonin production, leading to lighter, shorter sleep. Studies have shown that light in bedrooms can suppress melatonin levels by over 50 percent. That's why blackout curtains are a must for those who sleep after sunrise! But an easier and cheaper way to block out light is to get all our rest when the sun goes down. This leads us to the next important factor for sleep: timing. Timing is Everything! Of course it's good to do the right thing. But it is not right to do this at the wrong time. This is like applying sunscreen in the evening or watering flowers in the rain. We can do everything right, but if we don't pay attention to our timing, we won't get the best rest possible . Now let's look at some scheduling tips to improve our night's rest. First, we must respect our biological clock by going to bed within 30 minutes, at the same time every night. The modern business world encourages us to cut back on sleep during the week and catch up on weekends, but this wreaks havoc on our circadian rhythms. Our bodies don't know when it is Sunday. He can't adapt fast enough to our late-night Netflix binges on weekends ! If we routinely go to bed at a fixed time, our circadian rhythm will work smoothly. This way, it will be much easier to fall asleep and wake up. Secondly, yes it will be very classic but we should go to bed early and wake up early. We should not hear him scolding for not going to bed at night and not waking up in the morning. A 2008 study by researchers at the University of North Texas reveals the importance of waking up early in the morning. It has been observed that students identified as morning people get higher academic grades. It was found that the GPA of morning owls was 3.5, while the GPA of night owls was only 2.5. If we get to the root of the reason for this, we need to look at our DNA. Humans are a diurnal species. So it is a breed that needs to be active throughout the day. We have been hunter-gatherers for most of human history. Our ancestors were programmed to sleep after sunset because napping during the day was the easiest way to be eaten by a predator. When you examine it, you will see that the same principle applies in all communities regarding waking up early . A Chinese proverb says: anyone who can get out of bed before sunrise cannot fail to make his family rich. I personally am a sucker for waking up early. I don't remember waking up at 09:00, even on weekends, for many years . As far as I have examined both in my own life and around me, I have seen that those who take care of their mornings gain materially and spiritually. As a third principle regarding timing, we should take advantage of the magic sleep window between 22:00 and 02:00 at night . These hours are when our body reaches its highest production of hormones such as melatonin and growth hormone . This means that the sleep between these hours; This means that sleep is deeper and more rejuvenating than sleeping after 2am . This is bad news for those working the night shift. Sure, they can sleep for 8 or 9 hours after work, but they will get less restorative sleep than someone who sleeps those hours . Right Lifestyle! Understanding the biological aspects of sleep is important, but biology is only one side of the coin. We need to combine this knowledge with the right lifestyle to take our sleep game to the next level . First of all, it's worth getting a handle on the caffeine thing. Caffeine is a nervous system stimulant that is very similar to adenosine at the molecular level. What we call adenosine is a chemical that our brain produces while we are awake, and when our adenosine levels reach a certain point, we start to feel sleepy. So what happens if this adenosine is blocked? Yes, you know, you will lose sleep. Here, caffeine firmly lodges in the same receptors in our brain that adenosine is trying to enter, blocking its path. That's why we don't feel tired after drinking coffee. The half-life of caffeine is eight hours. In other words, 200 milligrams taken at 7:00 in the morning increases to 100 milligrams at 3:00 in the afternoon; At 11:00 in the evening , it turns into 50 mg. That's why it's best to stay away from caffeine after 16:00. If we do this, our body can completely get rid of caffeine as bedtime approaches. This way, our process of falling asleep will be easier. If you consume alcohol in the evening, this is another issue you should pay attention to. Although a few drinks may help you fall asleep, it has a very disturbing effect once you fall asleep, limiting the time you spend in the deeper stages of sleep. Alcohol interferes with REM sleep, the sleep phase responsible for memory processing. It does. In summary, sweets with alcohol harm the processes of learning and strengthening intelligence . A Healthy Mind - A Healthy Body As can be seen, quality sleep is essential for a healthy body and sharp mind. But the opposite is also true: A healthy body and mind are vital for a good night's sleep. Let's start with the body. One of the benefits of exercise is that it helps you get better quality sleep. Exercise creates micro-tears in our muscle tissue that our body must repair. As a result, our brain releases a number of rejuvenating anabolic hormones such as testosterone and growth hormone (HGH). All of this repair work allows the body to enter a deeper, more restorative sleep . The book mentions that Magnesium supplementation is another great way to stay healthy and enhance your sleep. Namely: This mineral is responsible for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body, but it is especially good for reducing stress and calming our nervous system. Magnesium balances blood sugar levels, optimizes blood pressure and relaxes muscles. All of these actually mean a better quality sleep. However, when supplementing with magnesium, it is beneficial to apply it to your skin in cream form. This is the most effective way because much of the power of this mineral is lost during digestion , making oral supplements weaker. It is also possible to externally supplement the melatonin hormone, which is closely related to sleepiness. This can be especially effective for those who suffer from insomnia, but there are risks associated with it. The biggest gripe is that melatonin supplements can inhibit your body's ability to produce it naturally . For this reason alone, it should be considered as a last resort. So, in the final analysis, it would be beneficial to consult your doctor. Maintaining a healthy mind is also key to quality sleep. This is why meditation is important. It is estimated that more than 50,000 thoughts pass through our minds every day. While most of this is short-lived, our internal monologue often intensifies when we're trying to fall asleep. But meditation can change this. Closing our eyes and focusing on our breathing, even for just 10 minutes, has been proven to reduce stress and prepare us for sleep by releasing feel-good endorphins into our system. In short, meditation is like a tonic for our manic, hyperactive minds. To start meditation, you need a sleep shelter. The answer is in the next heading. Sleeping Sanctuary! What good are all these sleep tips if we ignore where we sleep? Our environment has a huge impact on the quality of our rest, so we need to take sleep seriously, creating a sleep sanctuary so to speak. The key here is that our sleep sanctuary has fresh, clean air and evokes a sense of relaxation. Moving houseplants to the bedroom can be a solution for this. The organic views and earthy scents of greenery can calm you and increase your happiness level. Plants are excellent natural air filters. And maintaining good air quality is crucial when creating sleeping sanctuaries. This is because air contains ions; In simplest terms, these are electrically charged atoms. Ions with a negative electrical charge are extremely energizing. They improve our health by oxidizing mold, parasites and toxic chemical gases. But over time, the air we breathe becomes stale as its oxygen content decreases and ions lose their negative charge . Plants fix this by converting carbon dioxide into oxygen and replenishing the air with ions . So it is beneficial to have plants in your home. The example given in the book for this is English Ivy. This plant is an extremely durable plant. It has also been found by NASA to be the best air-filtering houseplant, pumping out oxygen and absorbing formaldehyde, a harmful neurotoxin that is very common in industrialized countries . Another great choice is mother-in-law's tongue. This is a hardy plant part that requires minimal water and light to survive. Perfect for a dark bedroom! Its most striking feature is that it can convert carbon dioxide into oxygen at night; most plants only do this during the day. But if there's one golden rule for sleep sanctuaries, it's this: Keep work out of the bedroom. Bringing phone calls, texts, and emails into your sleeping area is one of the worst things you can do. By doing this, you give your brain the message that your bedroom is your work area, and a negative association is established. At the same time, you create stress here, so your levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, increase in your bedroom , which is not good for sleep. We have to be strict with ourselves and not let it get into the bedroom. This is a place where we need to close down and isolate ourselves from all other external factors. Now all that's left is to step into your new sleep sanctuary armed with all these practical sleep tips and get ready for the best night's sleep you've ever had! Don't listen to the screams and shouts of modern life. Sleep is something to be embraced, not overcome. If we organize our lifestyles according to our biological clock and have sleep shelters, it will be possible for us to wake up early or on time and be energetic during the day . A practical suggestion; If you usually wake up at 8:00 in the morning and want to change this habit, do not try to wake up immediately at 6:00 in the morning. This is a shock to your system and can create a negative association in your brain, making it more difficult the next day. Instead, gradually move your alarm clock back 15 minutes each morning until you reach your ideal wake-up time. This will probably be easier to get used to because it will be much less of a drain on your willpower. Another sleep expert, Matt Walker, explains his two most important tips on sleep as follows. 1.Being Regular: Make sure to go to sleep at the same time and wake up at the same time. Whether it is weekdays or weekends. Being organized is the secret of this job. If sleep is regulated in this way, both its quantity and quality will increase. 2.Keep the Room Cool. In order to fall asleep and stay asleep, body temperature must drop by two to three degrees. You fall asleep more easily in a cold room than in a warm room. Therefore, try to keep the room temperature at 18 degrees. This would be ideal for most people's sleep.

O and S quadrants on the left. The C stands for \"employed\" and the S stands for \"self-employed or self-employed.\" On the right are the I and Y quarters. The i stands for \"business owner\" and the Y stands for \"investor\". We all basically belong to one of these four quadrants. A doctor may decide to earn his living as a C, that is, an employee. For this, he will need to join the staff of a hospital. Which means he has to land an eight-to-five job. The same doctor may also be an S, i.e., self-employed and choose to open a private practice . He sets up an office, hires staff, and creates a patient list. It's still hard work but you will have more control. As a third option, this doctor may decide to become a PR, a big business owner . He owns his own clinic and hires other doctors. In this case, he will likely employ someone else to run the organization. Thus, he becomes the owner of the clinic, but does not have to work himself. As a high-income physician, he will likely have an investable income as well. So, while he's practicing medicine, managing his clinic, or overseeing his business, he can also be a \"Y\" investor. He can do this by investing in stocks or real estate. This is the basic structure of society. All these quarters require different abilities and personal characteristics. Some people find their place in life and are happy no matter what quarter they are in . There is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" choice here. But what if you want to be financially free? If you want to escape the world of work and drudgery? Then you will need to move from the E and S quarters to the I and Y quarters. In short, you should be promoted from working to having. In Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant, the second book in the Rich Dad Poor Dad series, Robert Kiyosaki describes how some people find financial success without working hard . Aren't you tired of being trapped in a rat race every day? I don't know if you realize, time passes, life passes and most of us sell every day for the dreams of others. Those who realize this and hesitate are looking for a way out. That's probably why you're watching this video. Good then. Let's accompany you on this journey and try to contribute to your knowledge pool, even if it is a drop . Studying and working hard will not get you financial freedom. Robert Kiyosaki had two father figures. One was his biological father, who worked for the government. The other was the father of his friend Mike, a self-made businessman and investor . He came to know them as his poor father and rich father. As he observed their lives, he learned basic principles about business and money. Apparently, Kiyosaki's biological father was successful - he was well-educated and respected. However, as a civil servant, he was overwhelmed by the workload. As a result, he had little time to spend with his family or to enjoy his other passion, reading . On the other hand, Mike's father, a businessman and investor, always seemed to have both time and money. Rather than spend all his time in the E and S quarters, he had decided to avoid the 8-5 shift. Early in his life, he slowly began to buy properties. He eventually built a hotel empire. He had time in the world now. Midas is a brokerage house where you can invest in the American Stock Exchanges and Borsa Istanbul with advantageous commission rates from your investment account . As it is a relatively new application, some people may have reservations about reliability, but it is worth repeating that Midas is a licensed brokerage house authorized by the CMB. In other words, all its activities are under the control of the CMB on a regular basis. Shares purchased on American stock exchanges are registered in the user name , and investments up to $500,000 are protected by SIPC, a state-guaranteed insurance company. You can also register to Midas with the link in the explanations. I also highly recommend following Midas' website and YouTube channel . Because it has really good quality content. We Cannot Rely on Governments for Pensions. In fact, most of us still tend to think the way our parents did. That is, if we work hard and get a job with insurance, the state will already take care of us later in life. Unfortunately, its validity is slowly starting to fade. Of course, you can have a pension in the future. But how much purchasing power will it provide you? If you are having a hard time living in your current conditions , it is likely that life will become more difficult in the face of this reduced salary when you retire . For this, it is useful to take precautions before it is too late. So what should we do? For lifelong financial security, it would be wiser to switch to one of the right-hand I or Y quadrants: Own or Invest in a Business. Two father figures taught Kiyosaki a vital lesson here. His biological father worked hard as a civil servant and sought reassurance in later life. But then he loses his job. He was surprised. He has few business ventures as he has no experience in the I(B) and Y(I) quarters. However, he fails and gets stuck in debt. On the other hand, a passive income system flowing into Kiyosaki's \"rich father\" bank account created a steady flow of cash. He had entered the Y(I) quadrant early in his life, and this protected him for the rest of his days. The four quadrants attract different types of people. The four quadrants appeal to four different types of people. Let's look at the O (E) dial first. These are the employees of the organizations. Someone naturally gravitating to this quadrant will often use words like \"safety\" and \"benefits\" . They need to feel the benefits of a contract and a regular paycheck. And they often act out of fear. Fear of risk or “What if I go hungry” in quotes. Second, there's the S dial. These are self-employed or small business owners. These people like to be their own boss. When it comes to money, they don't like having their income determined by others. They know that if their business does not go well, they will earn less. In fact, they also act with fear. Fear of losing their independence. Third, we come to the B(B) quarter, the big business owners. In many ways they are the opposite of those in the S quadrant. They choose to surround themselves with smart people from all other categories. Their main skill is to delegate. At this point, Henry Ford is given as an example in the book. He wasn't the most gifted financial analyst or mechanical engineer, but he was very good at hiring others to do these jobs for him. Those in quadrant B can leave their entire operations running without doing anything. Instead, they oversee a system that continues to make money for them. Finally, we come to the Y(I) quarter, the investors. This quarter is often the domain of the ultra-rich. And it is what characterizes them. They take calculated risks. Like gamblers, they are not afraid of volatility. But unlike gamblers, they like to research their risk so that it is no longer such a dangerous possibility. A great investor like Warren Buffet embraces the danger of a financially cyclical world . But he also makes sure he understands all the risks involved better than anyone else. This is the key point for anyone who wants to achieve financial freedom. The surest way to achieve financial freedom is to have a job so you can invest. If you've come this far in the video, financial freedom really interests you . If you start this awareness at an early age, then it is better. It feels so good to have time to do the things you love. Or, on the contrary, having the freedom not to do things he doesn't like… But how do we get to that point? If you look at how most of the rich live, they seem to follow a similar path. you will see. If you look at how people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet got rich, you'd see that they were first in the I (B) quarter, and then they moved into the Y (I) quarter. The reason for this is quite simple. It is important to accumulate capital to become rich. The surest way to do this is to invest - in stocks, funds or properties. But to invest effectively, you will need ready capital and time. The best way to achieve this is to start a business that can make money while you sleep. This means setting up a system that can work even when you are away. If you do not have a significant cash asset, even if the return on your investments is high in percentage, it will be very limited in quantity. When you reach significant capital and invest it wisely, you will see how the road to financial freedom is shortened. Working in your fixed-pay job or running a small business can give you an edge later on. You know which business model is more successful or unsuccessful. You will gain experience in at least one industry. You have a business acumen. Without a business acumen, failure in investment is likely. Many people in the C(E) and S(S) quadrants try to get into the Y(I) quadrants quickly. Because he doesn't see what makes a great business system in practice, he's likely to make terrible investments. Now, maybe you don't have a desire to start or run a big business, but you still want to invest. If that's your path, you should at least learn about the different types of investors. It is worth mentioning this in the next section. There are five different classes of investors. For most people, becoming an investor is a daunting prospect. It feels like learning to surf at a beach known for sharks. However, with a little training, a novice can become a confident investor. So what distinguishes a beginner from Warren Buffet, for example? First, “Zero Level of Financial Intelligence”. Unfortunately, most of us fall into this category. These are people who have nothing to invest in, even if they are temporarily wealthy . This is because they are in more debt than their income allows. In order to become an investor, they must first balance their financial situation. Second, the “Savers Lose Level”. As the name suggests, this is also a level of financial ignorance. The accepted thinking is that simply saving money means financial security in the future. However, interest levels are not very high in the modern economy. So if you just park your money in a bank account, you will get very little return. And as we saw in the 2008 financial crisis, those who saved their money in bonds often zeroed in on their savings. Saving is not enough. The third level is “I'm Too Busy Investor”. These are people who just hand over their money to a financial advisor. While these investors are often more successful than the first two groups, they still carry a great deal of risk. This is because they have entrusted their money to people who are not actually successful. Fourth, we come to the \"I'm a Professional Level\". This is the first type of true investor. These are people who educate themselves, for example, about investing in stocks or real estate . They do their in-depth research. In this way, they focus more on their investments and develop a financial education that will serve them well throughout their lives. What we need to do in this insecure world is to reach this level of knowledge. Financial education is a big investment in itself. Finally, we have the \"Capitalist Level\". This is the Warren Buffet level. It consists of two steps. First you become a successful B(B) or S(S) investor. You then direct your capital towards riskier investments. This is the best route to great wealth, but it is also the steepest slope to climb. If building a business empire isn't your goal, then the previous \"I'm a Professional\" investor level is more attainable! Money causes irrational emotions that we have to overcome. We are not always rational. When it comes to money, the irrationality is at its peak. Just like the board game Monopoly, the rules are actually very simple. The best way to win in this game: to have as many houses as possible. In the real money world these \"houses\" could be anything from rental properties to stocks , but the same logic applies. Being able to look at money rationally and then learn how to earn it is a real gift. Baby Steps and the Long Term Perspective. Even if it is the longest journey, your starting point is that first step. Achieving financial freedom means going on a long journey. Therefore, you should be careful about trying to get rich in the short term. The truth is, no one ever got rich by just thinking short-term, and more importantly, didn't stay rich. Most of the time we want immediate gratification. But as they say, Rome wasn't built in a day. In fact, most of the biggest investors started small and went up. Even Warren Buffet started selling gum from door to door. Therefore, you should start small and set attainable goals. Do not overstress yourself or your finances in the rush to get rich. The future, unfortunately, means less job security. So even if you currently have a great, well-paying job, don't get addicted to making money that way. It's unlikely to last forever. With this in mind, the best way to achieve financial freedom is through long-term, compound investments. You should start your investments right away - no matter how small. You should put your dividends or profits back into your investments. Now your investment is bigger, so your profit will be bigger too. Remember, \"Compound returns are the eighth wonder of the world.\" A. Einstein. It may sound very cliché. But I think this is the most important. To achieve financial freedom, you have to invest in something else - your financial education. Because risk comes from what we don't know. So we should focus on reducing the number of things we don't know and become masters of our lives rather than being slaves to a fixed salary..."}]}
