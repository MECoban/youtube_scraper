I’m the proud owner of a highly coveted advertising agency called IAG Media that has worked with clients such as Oura Ring, Kevin Rose, AJ&Smart, FuroSystems & many, many more. 

I run the leading education company for agency owners - GrowYourAgency. We have thousands of students, with dozens making 6-figures, multi-6 figures & now even 7-figures a year PROFIT. I take a large chunk of my yearly profits & use that to build schools in Nepal. As of writing this, over 700+ get to wake up and go to schools that GrowYourAgency fully funded. 

I also run a physical e-commerce clothing line - Gadzhi. Everything is bespoke and made in house. It’ the only range of clothes out there that represents the animalistic Entrepreneurial spirit while quite frankly… not looking cringe or being just another print on demand shopify store.

AlexHormozi,top,4 Paths To Ultra Wealth,listicle,"paths, ultra, wealth","Download your free scaling roadmap here: https://www.acquisition.com/roadmap
The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)

26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

There’s a saying, money follows mastery, and I’m a big believer in that. You see, most people in life focus on the result instead of the journey, and even if they make some money, I can guarantee you that they never reach their full potential.

Take sales for example, the ones that focus on the sale and the money, will rarely (if never) outperform the ones who focus on the prospect's needs and changing lives, that’s just a fact.

Watch this video now to discover what it means to achieve mastery and to fully reach your potential.

Most entrepreneurs and service providers struggle to get referrals — not because they’re bad at what they do, but because they’re unknowingly creating friction in the process.

In this clip, Dan Lok breaks down the 3 biggest hidden referral barriers that keep your best clients from sending you business… even when they want to. From misunderstanding relational capital to expecting clients to become your unpaid sales team, Dan exposes the flawed thinking that sabotages your growth.

More importantly, you’ll learn a simple, high-leverage strategy to flip the script — one that removes pressure from your clients and makes referring you feel natural, effortless, and even rewarding.

If you want to grow fast without chasing, begging, or cold pitching… this is the mindset shift you’ve been missing.

Framing the conversation in a certain way gives you power or you loose power because of it. If the prospect gets the feeling of ""this is just another sales call"", than they are going to treat it exactly like that. So avoid the typical sales phrases whenever possible.

Thinking about buying a farm but don’t know where to start? In this video, Tai Lopez breaks down exactly how he went from online entrepreneur to owning multiple farms—including this 300-acre organic farm.

🌾 Learn the 3 key steps to buying a farm:
1 • How to pick the right location (latitudes, rainfall, and growing seasons)
2 • What soil types actually matter (limestone vs. glacial vs. sandy)
3 • Why infrastructure is everything (don’t buy raw land unless you really know what you're doing)

Tai also shares bonus insights like:
• Where in the world has the best farmland (U.S., Europe, Brazil?)
• What mistakes to avoid as a first-time buyer
• How to bring a piece of the city with you to avoid culture shock
• The real dangers of farm life—and how to ease into it

1️⃣ 2025 yılında düşük maaş zam yüzdeleri, insanların kendini psikolojik olarak korumaya almasına sebep oldu ve daha az alışveriş yaptılar. 🛑🛒

2️⃣ Artık rekabet artışı, algoritmalar ve genel piyasa eskisi gibi değil. 🚀

Tabii ki her zaman bu şekilde olmayacak, ama buradan öğrenmemiz gereken şeyler var.

⚠️Bilinirlik her zaman önemliydi ama artık çok daha önemli: Marka bilinirliğinize düzenli olarak yatırım yapmak zorundasınız!

Eğer sizin de satışlarınız düştüyse ve “Ne yapsam olmuyor” gibi kapana kısılmış hissediyorsanız, bu haftanın YouTube videosunu mutlaka izleyin. 🎥📢

Zeynepology⁩ kanalı ile Merak Et, Keşfet, Öğren 👉  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzYWBBjzS2ZwHHH_-NhNz8g

🎙️ Küçük bir çocuğun sesiyle anlatılan bu hikâye, “Bilge Kumbara” adlı sihirli bir karakterin rehberliğinde; para yönetimi, borç bilinci, ihtiyaç ve istek ayrımı, zamanın değeri, mutluluk kavramı ve hayal kurma cesareti gibi hayati kavramları sade ama etkileyici bir şekilde işliyor.

💡 Videoda Neler Var?
*Finansal okuryazarlık kavramına çocukça bir bakış
*Zaman Pazarı ile zamanın nasıl harcandığını fark etme
*Hayal Bankası ile uzun vadeli düşünmenin gücü
*Borç Bataklığı ile tüketim kültürünün görünmeyen bedelleri
*İstek ve İhtiyaçlar Ormanı ile bilinçli tüketim alışkanlıkları
*Mutluluk Bakkalı ile maddi ve manevi tatmin arasındaki fark
*Kendi Kurallarını Yazmak: Parayla değil, anlamla zenginleşmek

🎯 Kimler Bu Videoyu İzlemeli?

-Zamanı, parayı ve mutluluğu yeniden tanımlamak isteyen gençler

The event featured an elite roster of speakers who delved into the pressing issues of our time: Foreign relations, how AI will reshape global order, the new economy in a post-pandemic world, the impact of Chat GPT, international politics, and cultural revolutions.

Closing the special event was this extraordinary lecture from Dr. Jordan Peterson. In this provocative presentation, Peterson explores the profound question of why we -- as individuals -- hold the beliefs we do, while teaching us how to intricately weave the concept of storytelling into our narrative. He also embarks on a discovery to uncover order amidst chaos, as well as touches on the importance of overcoming external predators by confronting them head-on.

Courtesy of Tony and Sage Robbins, prepare to be enlightened by the singular Dr. Jordan Peterson. Please enjoy!

TonyRobbinsLive,top,"""This Is PROOF Your Beliefs Create Your Reality"" - Dr Bruce Lipton",guest,"proof, beliefs, create, reality, dr, bruce, lipton","Welcome to an eye-opening and timeless presentation from Dr. Bruce Lipton, a world-renowned 
cellular biologist and bestselling author celebrated for his groundbreaking work in epigenetics.

In this exclusive talk, recorded live at Tony and Sage Robbins' Platinum Spirituality Program in 
2020, Dr. Lipton presents “The Biology of Personal Empowerment.” He delves into how our 
beliefs and perceptions shape our biology, challenging the traditional view that our genes solely 
determine our fate. Instead, Dr. Lipton reveals how our thoughts, environment, and 
consciousness play a pivotal role in our health, as well as physical and emotional well-being.

Drawing from cutting-edge science and quantum physics, Dr. Lipton has uncovered a profound 
truth: what we once thought of as purely physical is actually energy in motion.

As Dr. Bruce Lipton says, “we are not victims of our genes, but masters of our fates, able to 
create lives overflowing with peace, happiness, and love.”

This episode will teach you how to master your perceptions and expand your knowledge so that 
you can transform your life.

Join us as we unlock the power of consciousness and learn how it can radically shift your health, 
mindset, and the way you interact with the world.  Enjoy!

Eckhart Tolle's TWO international bestsellers —The Power of Now and A New Earth —have been translated into 52 languages. Tolle has introduced millions of humans around the globe to the joy and freedom of living life in the present moment. 

The New York Times describes him as “the most popular spiritual author in the United States,” and Watkins Review named him “the most spiritually influential person in the world.”
 
Tolle’s profound yet simple teachings and benevolent essence (not to mention sweater vests) volunteer friendly encouragement to a state of inner peace in daily life. 

With teachings that focus on form identity vs. essence identity, the power of our present moment awareness, deep sensory perception, a pursuit of expanding consciousness, and the transcendence of the human stream of constant subconscious thoughts, Eckhart Tolle calls to all those who long to wake up.

This transcendence of mind and vibrant mental health could be the essential next step in all human evolution. We invite you to sit in the theatre of TONY AND SAGE ROBBINS | HAPPINESS CONFERENCE presented to their Platinum Partners in Sedona, Arizona. NOTE: This historic conversation took place through Zoom video and the enlightening lens of the year 2020. 

Immerse yourself in this profound knowledge and learn how to navigate life’s challenges and experience all that present moment mindfulness offers us. What would happen if you settle into a clarity of mind without problems or anxious thoughts? Listen in and life may never be the same again.

He has been named in the top 50 of Worth Magazine’s 100 most powerful people in global finance for three consecutive years, honored by Accenture as one of the ""Top 50 Business Intellectuals in the World''; by Harvard Business Press as one of the ""Top 200 Business Gurus""; and by American Express as one of the ""Top Six Business Leaders in the World"" to coach its entrepreneurial clients. Fortune’s recent cover article named him the “CEO Whisperer.”

He is a leader called upon by leaders, and has worked with four US presidents, top entertainers -- from Aerosmith to Green Day, to Usher and Pitbull, as well as athletes like Serena Williams, Andre Agassi, and the 2022 NBA Champion Golden State Warriors. Billionaire business leaders seek his advice as well; casino magnate Steve Wynn, and Salesforce.com founder Marc Benioff are among those grateful for his coaching.
 
As a philanthropist, through his partnership with Feeding America, Mr. Robbins has provided over 985 million meals in the last 8 years to those in need. He is two years ahead of schedule to provide 1 billion meals. Through the Tony Robbins Foundation, he has also awarded over 2,500 grants and other resources to health and human services organizations, implemented life-changing curricula in 1,700+ correctional facilities and gathered thousands of young leaders from around the world with its teen programs. In addition, he provides fresh water to 250,000 people a day in India in order to fight the number one killer of children in that country-waterborne diseases."

From Dean Graziosi: In the brand new Weekly Wisdom video I just posted, I tackle the paralyzingly modern day dilemma of ""Lack of Time”. The number 1 reason most people say that they can't achieve success!!

When we think of ""not having enough time"" we think of the clock just ticking away and not giving us enough hours to accomplish our goals...

But have you ever considered a different sort of time that's stopping you dead in your tracks? Something I call emotional time...

Go watch the brand new video and my bet is you WILL NEVER look at time the same way again."
"deangraziosi,",top,Weekly Wisdom #350- The #1 Thing to Trust!!,guest,"weekly, wisdom, thing, trust","This week's Weekly Wisdom comes with an insanely important message about trust. And there is one thing that you MUST TRUST, yet so many of us ignore it and don't put out trust in it.

And if you start to trust this one thing, your life could change forever...

What is that one thing? Watch this Weekly Wisdom and find out!

And also, as I mention in this week’s Weekly Wisdom, to get two of my New York Time best-selling books for free, go to http://www.deansfreebook.com.

Hey friend — I’m Dean Graziosi.

If you're feeling stuck… burned out… or like you're meant for more, but the path isn't clear, you're in the right place.

I co-founded Mastermind.com with Tony Robbins because we believe the next generation of success isn’t found in college degrees or corporate ladders.
It’s in turning your life experience into a business that actually means something.

Whether you're a tired solopreneur, an unfulfilled professional, or someone who’s just had enough of settling, this channel is your blueprint to build momentum, master marketing, and finally thrive.

Here you’ll find straight-shooting advice on:
→ Building a business from what you already know
→ Creating unshakable confidence (even when starting from scratch)
→ Mastering the mindset + marketing skills that move the needle
→ And how to break through when it feels like nothing is working

If you're ready to turn your mess into your message and your knowledge into income, start here:
