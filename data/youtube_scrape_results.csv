ewU1Ig3nDmE,Top 5 Digital Marketing Trends For 2024,"Top 5 digital marketing trends for 2024

Trend #1: Companies will create podcasts over blogs

Ideally, you should have both, but podcasting it a blue ocean.

There are 1 billion blogs. And there are 7.8 billion people in the world.

That’s 1 blog for every 7.8 people.

On the flip side, there are 4.2 million podcasts.

That’s 1 podcast for every 1857 people.

Trend #2: Companies will spend time on the less popular social networks.

Although Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram are the more popular social networks, they don’t provide the best return on ad spend.

Here are the social networks that provided the best return on ad spend in the last 30 days.

X – 6.8
Pinterest – 5.2
Snap – 4.9
TikTok – 4.1
YouTube – 3.9
Instagram – 3.3
Facebook – 3.2
LinkedIn – 2.6

Trend #3: Marketing moats will become non-existent, other than brands.

What makes Jordan shoes special isn’t the quality of the shoes. There are a lot of other high-quality shoes.

It’s the brand (Jump Man logo).

What made Kylie Cosmetics popular was the brand… not the quality of the product.

Technology has made it easier to copy the competition.

But the one thing that can separate you is your brand.

Check out the percentage of SEO traffic that is brand-related based on revenue size.

It just enforces the power of a brand.

Trend #4: You’ll change the way you write content

There are two things in this trend.

First off, it used to be where 2300-word articles were the ones ranking at the top of Google.

Then it became 1447-word articles.

And now look at the average article length by industry.

It’s because of tiktokification. The average user spends 95 minutes a day consuming short-form content.

And the second thing is human-written content will outperform AI-written content.

94.12% of the time, human-written content outranked AI-generated content.

But what’s interesting is more marketers are relying on AI to create their content.

This should make it easier for your content to stand out.

Trend #5: Marketing will no longer focus on 1 region

Big companies are already doing this. Mid-size companies and startups will start.

Instead of just focusing on the US or the UK, you’ll have no choice but to expand globally.

It’s where the money is.

Plus it is less competitive in most regions outside of the US.

Here’s our traffic by region.


When we first popped on the Inc 5000 list, we were ranked number 21.

Our international expansion led the way for revenue growth.

We aren’t the only ones experiencing this… it’s why most Fortune 1000 companies have a global effort.",2024-01-02T17:53:59Z,77418,5106,23,UCl-Zrl0QhF66lu1aGXaTbfw,top

o9qSf9wEuMo,ChatGPT gets banned - The 110M impression LinkedIn page,"In a digital world where artificial intelligence and machine learning have become integral components of our daily lives, the suspension or banning of an AI entity can stir up waves of intrigue and curiosity. Such was the case when the highly popular and influential LinkedIn page featuring ChatGPT, a cutting-edge AI language model, was banned.

However, the ban of ChatGPT's LinkedIn page raised several questions and sparked a lively debate. The circumstances surrounding the ban were initially shrouded in mystery, as there was no official statement from LinkedIn or the creators of ChatGPT. Speculation and conspiracy theories emerged, further fueling the intrigue.

One theory suggested that the ban was due to concerns about the influence of AI on social media platforms and the potential for AI-generated content to spread disinformation. Others speculated that the page's rapid growth and outreach had caught the attention of competitors who wanted to stifle its success.

The incident also prompted a broader conversation about the regulation and oversight of AI on social media platforms. As AI becomes increasingly intertwined with our online interactions, questions about transparency, accountability, and ethical usage have taken center stage. The ChatGPT ban served as a catalyst for these discussions, with experts and policymakers weighing in on the need for clear guidelines and regulations.

While the fate of the ChatGPT LinkedIn page remains uncertain, one thing is clear: its ban marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI and its role in online communities. As the AI landscape continues to expand and evolve, so too will the discussions and debates surrounding its place in our digital world, making the ChatGPT ban an event of historical significance in the realm of artificial intelligence.

But after using it for a year or so, I’ve figured out how to get it to write an article that requires less editing.

Here’s the prompt I use on ChatGPT:

I want to write an article about [insert topic] that includes stats and cite your sources. And use storytelling in the introductory paragraph.

The article should be tailored to [insert your ideal customer].

The article should focus on [what you want to talk about] instead of [what you don’t want to talk about].

Please mention [insert your company or product name] in the article and how we can help [insert your ideal customer] with [insert the problem your product or service solves]. But please don't mention [insert your company or product name] more than twice.

And wrap up the article with a conclusion and end the last sentence in the article with a question.",2024-01-07T15:37:14Z,68316,2953,35,UCl-Zrl0QhF66lu1aGXaTbfw,top

First and foremost, blog posts are invaluable for SEO because they provide a platform for fresh and relevant content. Search engines like Google consistently prioritize content that is informative, up-to-date, and user-focused. Blog posts offer a flexible format to deliver this type of content. They allow businesses and website owners to share insights, updates, industry news, and other valuable information with their audience.

Moreover, blog posts are a means of targeting long-tail keywords and specific search queries. By crafting well-researched and informative blog posts around niche topics related to your industry or business, you can increase your chances of ranking higher in search results for these keywords. This targeted approach not only enhances your website's visibility but also attracts more qualified traffic.

Blog posts also foster engagement and interaction. They provide a platform for discussions, comments, and social sharing, which are important engagement signals for search engines. When readers engage with your content by commenting, sharing, or staying on your website longer, it sends positive signals to search engines, indicating that your content is valuable and relevant to your audience.

However, blog posts are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Their effectiveness depends on how they are crafted, optimized, and promoted.

Blog posts remain a powerful and versatile tool in contemporary SEO strategies. When executed effectively, they contribute to improving a website's visibility, attracting a targeted audience, and engaging users. 

However, the SEO landscape is dynamic, and it's crucial to adapt to changes in search engine algorithms and user preferences. 

Integrating blog posts as part of a broader SEO strategy, which includes technical SEO, on-page SEO, and off-page SEO, is a well-rounded approach to achieving success in today's competitive digital environment.

Making a poster for a grand play and spreading it? That's advertising.

When the audience fills the theater, enjoys the show, asks questions, buys merchandise, and spends more money - that's sales.

And if you planned the whole thing, from poster to final curtain - that's marketing.

K5WggmG371o,Montenegro'da Milyonlarca Dolarlık İş Gezisi (Sürpriz Son),"2025 yılındaki Fatih olarak milyonlarca dolar harcayarak Avrupa'da inşaat projeleri yürütebiliyorum.

tsqJuOsD-UE,"""This Is PROOF Your Beliefs Create Your Reality"" - Dr Bruce Lipton","Welcome to an eye-opening and timeless presentation from Dr. Bruce Lipton, a world-renowned 
cellular biologist and bestselling author celebrated for his groundbreaking work in epigenetics.

In this exclusive talk, recorded live at Tony and Sage Robbins' Platinum Spirituality Program in 
2020, Dr. Lipton presents “The Biology of Personal Empowerment.” He delves into how our 
beliefs and perceptions shape our biology, challenging the traditional view that our genes solely 
determine our fate. Instead, Dr. Lipton reveals how our thoughts, environment, and 
consciousness play a pivotal role in our health, as well as physical and emotional well-being.

Drawing from cutting-edge science and quantum physics, Dr. Lipton has uncovered a profound 
truth: what we once thought of as purely physical is actually energy in motion.

As Dr. Bruce Lipton says, “we are not victims of our genes, but masters of our fates, able to 
create lives overflowing with peace, happiness, and love.”

This episode will teach you how to master your perceptions and expand your knowledge so that 
you can transform your life.

Join us as we unlock the power of consciousness and learn how it can radically shift your health, 
mindset, and the way you interact with the world.  Enjoy!

Eckhart Tolle's TWO international bestsellers —The Power of Now and A New Earth —have been translated into 52 languages. Tolle has introduced millions of humans around the globe to the joy and freedom of living life in the present moment. 

The New York Times describes him as “the most popular spiritual author in the United States,” and Watkins Review named him “the most spiritually influential person in the world.”
 
Tolle’s profound yet simple teachings and benevolent essence (not to mention sweater vests) volunteer friendly encouragement to a state of inner peace in daily life. 

With teachings that focus on form identity vs. essence identity, the power of our present moment awareness, deep sensory perception, a pursuit of expanding consciousness, and the transcendence of the human stream of constant subconscious thoughts, Eckhart Tolle calls to all those who long to wake up.

This transcendence of mind and vibrant mental health could be the essential next step in all human evolution. We invite you to sit in the theatre of TONY AND SAGE ROBBINS | HAPPINESS CONFERENCE presented to their Platinum Partners in Sedona, Arizona. NOTE: This historic conversation took place through Zoom video and the enlightening lens of the year 2020. 

Immerse yourself in this profound knowledge and learn how to navigate life’s challenges and experience all that present moment mindfulness offers us. What would happen if you settle into a clarity of mind without problems or anxious thoughts? Listen in and life may never be the same again.

In this live presentation recorded at Tony & Sage Robbins’ 2024 Platinum Partners Happiness Event in Abu Dhabi, neuroscientist Andrew Newberg, M.D. explores “The Spiritual Brain: The Link Between Spirituality, Sexuality, and Happiness.” Drawing on cutting-edge fMRI and PET scans, Dr. Newberg defines exactly what a spiritual experience is and shows you where—and how—those moments light up your neural circuitry.

You’ll discover the core components that make these experiences so transformative and learn how repeated ritual practices reshape the brain over time. Along the way, he reveals the evolutionary roots of ritual and explains why religious and spiritual encounters have the power to change our views of reality, our relationships, our work—and even our deepest beliefs about God, science, and ourselves.

Watch now to uncover the surprising ways your own brain is wired for transcendence—and how that wiring can lead you to a more fulfilled, happier life.

Lha52-dlBmk,Why You Should Care More (The Strategy No One is Talking About) w/ Pace Morby,"If you’re on social media then chances are you’ve seen this week’s Own Your Future guest… he’s blowing up. 

In this special Father’s Day episode of Own YOUR Future, I got to sit down with author, entrepreneur, investor, community builder and new friend Pace Morby, who seems to have come out of nowhere… 

But if you’ve been following me for a while, you know there’s no such thing as overnight success. 

Pace’s “secret to success” could be summed up in one line: “I win because I do what others won’t do, don’t do, can’t do.” 

Pace is the founder of Subto, an educational resource for experienced and novice real estate investors that teaches the freedom of creative financing in the United States. He’s host of A&E’s “Triple Digit Flip” and has built a wildly successful real estate empire. Pace is one of the most creative real estate investors out there. He’s also an amazing husband and father with a heart to serve. 

In fact, let me ask you… would you let a $1 million dollar bankruptcy letter stop you? 

Would you be willing to drive strangers around with you and show them HOW to make deals? 

Would you be willing to fail in front of those people and show them HOW to learn from that and keep moving forward? 

That’s exactly what Pace did. He put in the work and did what other people aren’t willing to do. It’s no wonder he’s created the amount of success he has today… he put people first. 

✌️ If you have been screwed over and want to learn how to turn that into something positive, this episode is for you. 
✌️ If you’ve had some success and still think you’re “not good enough,” this episode is for you. 
✌️ If you want to learn how to create a thriving community, this episode is a must listen! 
✌️ If you’re a mom or dad trying to balance building a business and being a parent, this episode is for you. 

I can’t wait for you to dive into this episode and hear Pace’s story. It is inspiring, encouraging, and a lesson in how important relationships are for achieving success in business at every stage of your journey.  

And if you learned something today… if we inspired you, motivated you, encouraged you in some way please share in the comments below and share this episode with someone you care about.

Hcmie1-2xLo,Bend the World to Your Will: How To Use the PHYSICS OF PROGRESS to Create Success w/ Tom Bilyeu,"In today’s world there’s a big emphasis on being “special”... but the truth is, you don’t have to be special to be successful. According to today’s guest on the Own YOUR Future Podcast, you should really embrace being AVERAGE instead. 

Tom Bilyeu is an entrepreneur who’s had extraordinary success. He’s co-founder of the billion-dollar brand QUEST NUTRITION alongside his wife Lisa Bilyeu. A company he built from the ground up by being average and simply practicing what he calls the “physics of progress.” 

Personally driven to expand people’s vision of wellness to a 360-degree view that encompasses body and mind, Tom has created the podcast, “IMPACT THEORY” to help people develop the skills they will need to improve themselves and the world.
He is also the CREATOR of ""Project Kyzen,"" a groundbreaking NFT-powered AI DIGITAL WORLD that offers a truly unique & customizable experience.

Tom’s reputation as a force of change is undeniable. He was named one of Success Magazine’s Top 25 Influential People & Entrepreneur of the Year by Secret Entourage and this episode is full of insights you won’t hear anywhere else… 

🔥  What are the PHYSICS OF PROGRESS and how you can use them to set yourself up for extraordinary success
🔥 The ONLY belief that matters when it comes to success 
🔥 How to bend the world to YOUR WILL 
🔥 Why sometimes going to the “DARK SIDE” is necessary… just don’t stay there too long
🔥 The only thing that REMOVES INSECURITY
🔥 Why you can’t base your VALUE on accomplishments and what to use instead 
🔥 The difference between BRAND MARKETING and DIRECT RESPONSE marketing 

Plus we share their insights on where they think the world is heading in the next decade and how you can be prepared...

We talked about the impact of A.I on business, marketing trends… and at the end, I help Tom in real-time with a marketing problem he’s currently facing!

There’s a saying, money follows mastery, and I’m a big believer in that. You see, most people in life focus on the result instead of the journey, and even if they make some money, I can guarantee you that they never reach their full potential.

Take sales for example, the ones that focus on the sale and the money, will rarely (if never) outperform the ones who focus on the prospect's needs and changing lives, that’s just a fact.

Watch this video now to discover what it means to achieve mastery and to fully reach your potential.

Most entrepreneurs and service providers struggle to get referrals — not because they’re bad at what they do, but because they’re unknowingly creating friction in the process.

In this clip, Dan Lok breaks down the 3 biggest hidden referral barriers that keep your best clients from sending you business… even when they want to. From misunderstanding relational capital to expecting clients to become your unpaid sales team, Dan exposes the flawed thinking that sabotages your growth.

More importantly, you’ll learn a simple, high-leverage strategy to flip the script — one that removes pressure from your clients and makes referring you feel natural, effortless, and even rewarding.

If you want to grow fast without chasing, begging, or cold pitching… this is the mindset shift you’ve been missing.

Framing the conversation in a certain way gives you power or you loose power because of it. If the prospect gets the feeling of ""this is just another sales call"", than they are going to treat it exactly like that. So avoid the typical sales phrases whenever possible.

The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur, and serves as the Chairman of VaynerX,  the CEO of VaynerMedia and the Creator & CEO of VeeFriends.

Gary is considered one of the leading global minds on what’s next in culture,  relevance and the internet. Known as “GaryVee” he is described as one of the most forward thinkers in business – he acutely recognizes trends and patterns early to help others understand how these shifts impact markets and consumer behavior. Whether its emerging artists, esports, NFT investing or digital communications, Gary understands how to bring brand relevance to the forefront. He is a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase and Uber. 

Gary is an entrepreneur at heart — he builds businesses. Today, he helps Fortune 1000 brands leverage consumer attention through his full service advertising agency, VaynerMedia which has offices in NY, LA, London, Mexico City, LATAM and Singapore.  VaynerMedia is part of the VaynerX holding company which also includes VaynerProductions, VaynerNFT, Gallery Media Group, The Sasha Group, Tracer, VaynerSpeakers, VaynerTalent, and VaynerCommerce. Gary is also the Co-Founder of VaynerSports, Resy and Empathy Wines. Gary guided both Resy and Empathy to successful exits — both were sold respectively to American Express and Constellation Brands. He’s also a Board Member at Candy Digital, Co-Founder of VCR Group, Co-Founder of ArtOfficial, and Creator & CEO of VeeFriends. Gary was recently named to the Fortune list of the Top 50 Influential people in the NFT industry. 
In addition to running multiple businesses, Gary documents his life daily as a CEO through his social media channels which has more than 34 million followers and garnishes over 272 million monthly impressions/views across all platforms.  His podcast ‘The GaryVee Audio Experience’ ranks among the top podcasts globally.  He is a five-time New York Times Best-Selling Author and one of the most highly sought after public speakers.

Gary serves on the board of GymShark, MikMak, Bojangles Restaurants, and Pencils of Promise. He is also a longtime Well Member of Charity:Water.",2022-03-23T16:15:42Z,11645836,823207,6851,UCctXZhXmG-kf3tlIXgVZUlw,top

3A1o_EyEfXk,"If you're the best at THIS, AI can't take your job","Change is hard but it’s also inevitable. We are often accustomed to a certain way of doing things and may fall into a rut because of that. So many people are doing the same concept in the exact same way for far too long and that’s what’s keeping them from mixing it up and evolving creatively. 

Hope you enjoy this talk I gave to VaynerX's interns!

fjh5llEMFMc,2025'te E-Ticaret Yapmak İçin Bunu İzleyin.,"2025'te e-ticarette başarılı olmak için ne gerekiyor?

İhtiyacınız olan şey şüphesiz; buraya tıkla, buradan reklam yayınla gibi yüzlerce kere anlatılmış bilgiler değil.

İhtiyacınız olan şey, tam tersi; bu işin matematiğini öğrenmek. İşte onu da videoda adım adım anlattım.

E-ticarete başlamak için ekibimiz ile görüş: 
https://bit.ly/4ieccJa",2025-01-28T15:43:43Z,101290,4088,163,UCFM3FPTFHj5cXRA877sZ04Q,top
vKWxHht3d7Q,İlk 10 Günde Bunu Yap (2025 Uygulamalı E-Ticaret Eğitim),"8,5 ayda 9 milyon TL satış yaptığımız ve %35 karla devam eden mağazamızın ilk 10 gününde yaptığımız testleri bu video anlattım.

Bu mağazayı özellikle seçtim çünkü ilk günkü testleri başarısız olmuştu ve videoda anlattığım stratejilerle durumu değiştirebildik.

Bu videodan sonra artık rastgele ürün test etmeyi bırakıp, artık verilerinize bakarak aksiyon almayı öğreneceksiniz.

9 ay önce 30 bin TL reklam sermayesi ile başladığımız başladığımız ve toplamda 10 milyon TL satışı geçtiğimiz mağazanın net karlılık durumu ve sürecin arka planını bu videoda paylaştım.

Şeffaflık açısından yine ödeme teyitlerini de videonun sonunda görebilirsiniz.

dmQH7MRjGPQ,E-Ticaret İçin Ne Kadar Sermaye Lazım? (2025 Güncel),"Bu videoda 2025 itibari ile e-ticarete başlayacak birinin ortalama ne kadar sermayesi olması gerektiğini anlattım.

Videonun girişi sermaye gereksinimi kadar önemli, çünkü sermaye tek başına 'en önemli' faktör değil. Fakat sadece sermaye bilgisi için üç farklı sermaye baremini anlattım:

- Organik devam etmek isteyenler için sermaye gereksinimi,
- Yarı organik devam etmek isteyenler için sermaye gereksinimi,
- Paralı reklamlarla devam etmek isteyenler için sermaye gereksinimi.

Tabi videonun konusu mağaza cirosu değil; videoda hem bu mağazanın altyapı sistemlerini anlattım, hem de Türkiye'de açılan Finansman mağazalarımız ile, globalde açtığımız mağazalar arasındaki farkları özetledim.

Mağazaya hala devam ediyoruz. Ben videoyu çekeli 3 hafta oldu ve mağaza 19 Ocak itibari ile 390.000 dolar satışa ulaştı. Süreci Instagramdan daha canlı takip edebilirsiniz.

MM8WjdDNkAA,"Son 2 Ayda Satışların Çok Düştüyse ve Artıramıyorsan, Bu Videoyu İzle!","Satışlarınız son zamanlarda nasıl? Telefonum, son 2 ayda hiç olmadığı kadar şu sebeple çalmaya başladı: “Hocam, satışlarımız çok düştü, ne yapsak olmuyor, ciroları eski haline getiremiyoruz.” 📉

📲 Arayanlar arasında meslektaşlarım da vardı, marka sahipleri de.

Danışmanlığını yaptığımız bazı markalar da aynı sorunlarla biz de aynı şekilde boğuştuk.

Ama aynı zamanda, bilinirliği iyi olan ve bu yatırımı yapan markalarımıza baktığımızda ise sorunsuz ilerleyebildiğimizi de tecrübe ettik. ✅

Bunun 2 sebebi var:

1️⃣ 2025 yılında düşük maaş zam yüzdeleri, insanların kendini psikolojik olarak korumaya almasına sebep oldu ve daha az alışveriş yaptılar. 🛑🛒

2️⃣ Artık rekabet artışı, algoritmalar ve genel piyasa eskisi gibi değil. 🚀

Tabii ki her zaman bu şekilde olmayacak, ama buradan öğrenmemiz gereken şeyler var.

⚠️Bilinirlik her zaman önemliydi ama artık çok daha önemli: Marka bilinirliğinize düzenli olarak yatırım yapmak zorundasınız!

Eğer sizin de satışlarınız düştüyse ve “Ne yapsam olmuyor” gibi kapana kısılmış hissediyorsanız, bu haftanın YouTube videosunu mutlaka izleyin. 🎥📢

💰 If you’re doing more than $10 million, click the link below to get on a quick 10-minute call with me for free: 🌐 https://tailopez.com/10minsyt

⚠️ Your ads aren’t converting because you’re making the same mistakes 99% of entrepreneurs make. I’ve run some of the biggest online ad campaigns in history, and I’m telling you—if your product isn’t a “high-appetite” product, it’s not going to sell. 🛑
“You can’t polish a turd 💩, and you can’t sell something nobody really wants.” 💡

✍️ Key Takeaways:
1️⃣ Test Your Product’s Appetite: Make your product feel essential—like oxygen to someone gasping for air. 
2️⃣ Target the Right Audience: Keep your market size reasonable and speak directly to your ideal customer. 🎯
3️⃣ Implement the 12-12-12 Framework: Test 12 ads at a time, run them for 12 days, and do 12 iterations to find your best performer. 🔄
4️⃣ Appeal to Narcissism: Make your customer feel like the ad is speaking directly to them—don’t make it too generic. 👀
5️⃣ Use the Parking Lot Test: If your product doesn’t make people chase after you for more info, it’s not appealing enough. 

💸 Struggling to scale your ads or spending over $1 million a year without seeing results?
I’m opening a few spots for one-on-one calls to help serious entrepreneurs fix their ad strategy—fast.

Most entrepreneurs work harder than ever and still make less than a McDonald’s manager. Why? Because they never learned how to build a scalable business model. In this video, Tai Lopez breaks down the three steps to make real money without working 24/7 — including the power of building a personal brand (or a faceless one), getting paid to do what you’d do anyway, and focusing on your first 1,000 loyal customers using his 13/13 Rule.

Learn how to create income that doesn’t feel like work.
Whether you're a mom, a coach, a farmer, or just starting out — this video gives you the blueprint.

06uyb8Ho-Do,Build Gates,"Don't miss our 2023 Europe Tour: https://bit.ly/futureuro23

You must be more selective. You must be more discriminating. Be picky as to who you choose to work with.

Build gates to your product or service to filter out “poor fits”. How?

Be specific about what you do, who you do it for. This is reflected in the copy you write, and how you price your work.

Determine who your ideal clients are. What criteria do you use to determine if the client is a good fit for you? What rules do you have in place?

mKh1t4Hb1ps,Why Explaining Your Prices Undermines Your Leverage with Clients,"#shorts 

Explaining your prices undermines your leverage with clients by giving away too much information about your pricing strategy and leaving less room for negotiation.

Instead, it is better to use phrases like ""it's our policy"" or ""that's what we charge clients like you to do work like this"" to maintain some level of uncertainty and to leave room for negotiation and value-added services.

0BBOfeUHMA4,Küçük Bir Kızın Gözünden PARA | Yetişkinlere Anlatılmış En Tatlı Hikâye,"Bu animasyon hikâyeyi 23 Nisan Ulusal Egemenlik ve Çocuk Bayramı'na özel hazırladık. Sadece çocuklara değil, yetişkinlere de ilham verecek bir finansal yolculuğa çıkıyoruz. Küçük bir kızın gözünden, parayla olan ilişkimizi, zamanın kıymetini ve mutluluğun neyle ölçüldüğünü sorgulatan bu video sizi düşündürecek.

Zeynepology⁩ kanalı ile Merak Et, Keşfet, Öğren 👉  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzYWBBjzS2ZwHHH_-NhNz8g

🎙️ Küçük bir çocuğun sesiyle anlatılan bu hikâye, “Bilge Kumbara” adlı sihirli bir karakterin rehberliğinde; para yönetimi, borç bilinci, ihtiyaç ve istek ayrımı, zamanın değeri, mutluluk kavramı ve hayal kurma cesareti gibi hayati kavramları sade ama etkileyici bir şekilde işliyor.

💡 Videoda Neler Var?
*Finansal okuryazarlık kavramına çocukça bir bakış
*Zaman Pazarı ile zamanın nasıl harcandığını fark etme
*Hayal Bankası ile uzun vadeli düşünmenin gücü
*Borç Bataklığı ile tüketim kültürünün görünmeyen bedelleri
*İstek ve İhtiyaçlar Ormanı ile bilinçli tüketim alışkanlıkları
*Mutluluk Bakkalı ile maddi ve manevi tatmin arasındaki fark
*Kendi Kurallarını Yazmak: Parayla değil, anlamla zenginleşmek

🎯 Kimler Bu Videoyu İzlemeli?
-Çocuğuna finansal farkındalık kazandırmak isteyen ebeveynler
-Zamanı, parayı ve mutluluğu yeniden tanımlamak isteyen gençler
-23 Nisan’a özel anlamlı ve farkındalık dolu içerik arayan herkes
-Eğitimciler, psikolojik gelişimle ilgilenenler

🎈 Bu Sadece Bir Masal Değil…
Bu video, sıradan bir animasyon değil. Çünkü içinde hayal gücüyle harmanlanmış finansal dersler var.
Ve en önemlisi: Para sadece bir araç, asıl mesele hayatı nasıl yönettiğimiz.

💬 Yorumlara “Benim kuralım şuydu…” diye yazarak bu yolculuğa katkı verebilirsin!
📢 Videoyu arkadaşlarınla paylaşarak daha fazla çocuğa (ve büyüklere) ulaşmamıza destek olabilirsin!

6mHW6pFhAm0,Bu Psikolojik Teknik İnsanları Nasıl İKNA Ediyor?,"Psikolojik Etki: Kapıdan İçeri Adım Tekniği
Hiç planlamadığınız şeylere nasıl evet dediğinizi merak ettiniz mi? ""Kapıdan İçeri Adım"" tekniği, kararlarınızı farkında olmadan etkileyen, ince ama güçlü bir psikolojik hiledir.  

Nasıl çalışıyor? Küçük bir isteğe evet diyorsunuz ve fark etmeden çok daha büyük bir talebi de kabul ediyorsunuz. Bu teknik; satışta, pazarlamada ve günlük hayatta sıkça kullanılır. Her şey, kendinizi nasıl gördüğünüzle ilgilidir—bir kez yardımsever veya ilgili biri olarak kendinizi görmeye başladığınızda, aynı şekilde davranmaya devam edersiniz.  

Bu videoda, bu psikolojik stratejinin nasıl çalıştığını, gerçek dünyadan örneklerle açıklıyoruz ve gerektiğinde nasıl tanıyıp direnebileceğinizi gösteriyoruz. İnce etki taktiklerinin kararlarınızı kontrol etmesine izin vermeyin!
