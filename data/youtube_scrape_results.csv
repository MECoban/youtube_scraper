0BBOfeUHMA4,Küçük Bir Kızın Gözünden PARA | Yetişkinlere Anlatılmış En Tatlı Hikâye,"Bu animasyon hikâyeyi 23 Nisan Ulusal Egemenlik ve Çocuk Bayramı'na özel hazırladık. Sadece çocuklara değil, yetişkinlere de ilham verecek bir finansal yolculuğa çıkıyoruz. Küçük bir kızın gözünden, parayla olan ilişkimizi, zamanın kıymetini ve mutluluğun neyle ölçüldüğünü sorgulatan bu video sizi düşündürecek.

Zeynepology⁩ kanalı ile Merak Et, Keşfet, Öğren 👉  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzYWBBjzS2ZwHHH_-NhNz8g

🎙️ Küçük bir çocuğun sesiyle anlatılan bu hikâye, “Bilge Kumbara” adlı sihirli bir karakterin rehberliğinde; para yönetimi, borç bilinci, ihtiyaç ve istek ayrımı, zamanın değeri, mutluluk kavramı ve hayal kurma cesareti gibi hayati kavramları sade ama etkileyici bir şekilde işliyor.

💡 Videoda Neler Var?
*Finansal okuryazarlık kavramına çocukça bir bakış
*Zaman Pazarı ile zamanın nasıl harcandığını fark etme
*Hayal Bankası ile uzun vadeli düşünmenin gücü
*Borç Bataklığı ile tüketim kültürünün görünmeyen bedelleri
*İstek ve İhtiyaçlar Ormanı ile bilinçli tüketim alışkanlıkları
*Mutluluk Bakkalı ile maddi ve manevi tatmin arasındaki fark
*Kendi Kurallarını Yazmak: Parayla değil, anlamla zenginleşmek

🎯 Kimler Bu Videoyu İzlemeli?
-Çocuğuna finansal farkındalık kazandırmak isteyen ebeveynler
-Zamanı, parayı ve mutluluğu yeniden tanımlamak isteyen gençler
-23 Nisan’a özel anlamlı ve farkındalık dolu içerik arayan herkes
-Eğitimciler, psikolojik gelişimle ilgilenenler

🎈 Bu Sadece Bir Masal Değil…
Bu video, sıradan bir animasyon değil. Çünkü içinde hayal gücüyle harmanlanmış finansal dersler var.
Ve en önemlisi: Para sadece bir araç, asıl mesele hayatı nasıl yönettiğimiz.

💬 Yorumlara “Benim kuralım şuydu…” diye yazarak bu yolculuğa katkı verebilirsin!
📢 Videoyu arkadaşlarınla paylaşarak daha fazla çocuğa (ve büyüklere) ulaşmamıza destek olabilirsin!

🛩️ Took the jet back to LA from Sundance — there are levels to life, and levels to jets ✈️ This one? It’s got a bed and 1,100 ft of freedom. But the real message isn’t about the jet — it’s about storytelling.

In this video, I break down: 🔥 Why your brand needs a story
🔥 How I use storytelling to build my personal brand
🔥 Why people buy you before they buy your product
🔥 The secret behind Nike, Apple, and top brands
🔥 And how to turn storytelling into 7, 8, or even 9 figures

In this video, Tai Lopez breaks down the three steps to make real money without working 24/7 — including the power of building a personal brand (or a faceless one), getting paid to do what you’d do anyway, and focusing on your first 1,000 loyal customers using his 13/13 Rule.

- How I turned one-time deals into consistent monthly income
- Why focus beats diversification when you’re trying to scale

6WqN7rF6KHk,"The Unexpected Link Between Neuroscience, Spirituality & Happiness | Andrew Newberg, MD","Is your brain the secret key to spiritual development and happiness? In this live presentation recorded at Tony & Sage Robbins’ 2024 Platinum Partners Happiness Event in Abu Dhabi, neuroscientist Andrew Newberg, M.D. explores “The Spiritual Brain: The Link Between Spirituality, Sexuality, and Happiness.” Drawing on cutting-edge fMRI and PET scans, Dr. Newberg defines exactly what a spiritual experience is and shows you where—and how—those moments light up your neural circuitry.

You’ll discover the core components that make these experiences so transformative and learn how repeated ritual practices reshape the brain over time. Along the way, he reveals the evolutionary roots of ritual and explains why religious and spiritual encounters have the power to change our views of reality, our relationships, our work—and even our deepest beliefs about God, science, and ourselves.

Watch now to uncover the surprising ways your own brain is wired for transcendence—and how that wiring can lead you to a more fulfilled, happier life.

Don’t forget to subscribe for more breakthrough ideas from Tony Robbins, as well as the world’s leading thinkers. Please enjoy!

Tony Robbins is a #1 New York Times best-selling author, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and the nation's #1 Life and Business Strategist. For more than four and a half decades, more than 100 million people from 195 countries have enjoyed the warmth, humor, and transformational power of his business and personal development events. 

Mr. Robbins is the author of seven internationally bestselling books, including three #1 New York Times bestsellers: Money: Master the Game, Unshakeable, and Life Force.  He created the #1 personal and professional development program of all time, and more than 10 million people have attended his live seminars.
 
Anthony Robbins is the chairman of a holding company comprising more than 110 privately held businesses with combined sales exceeding $7 billion a year. He has been named in the top 50 of Worth Magazine’s 100 most powerful people in global finance for three consecutive years, honored by Accenture as one of the ""Top 50 Business Intellectuals in the World''; by Harvard Business Press as one of the ""Top 200 Business Gurus""; and by American Express as one of the ""Top Six Business Leaders in the World"" to coach its entrepreneurial clients. Fortune’s recent cover article named him the “CEO Whisperer.”

He is a leader called upon by leaders, and has worked with four US presidents, top entertainers -- from Aerosmith to Green Day, to Usher and Pitbull, as well as athletes like Serena Williams, Andre Agassi, and the 2022 NBA Champion Golden State Warriors. Billionaire business leaders seek his advice as well; casino magnate Steve Wynn, and Salesforce.com founder Marc Benioff are among those grateful for his coaching.
 
As a philanthropist, through his partnership with Feeding America, Mr. Robbins has provided over 985 million meals in the last 8 years to those in need. He is two years ahead of schedule to provide 1 billion meals. Through the Tony Robbins Foundation, he has also awarded over 2,500 grants and other resources to health and human services organizations, implemented life-changing curricula in 1,700+ correctional facilities and gathered thousands of young leaders from around the world with its teen programs. In addition, he provides fresh water to 250,000 people a day in India in order to fight the number one killer of children in that country-waterborne diseases.",2025-05-08T13:00:06Z,UCJLMboBYME_CLEfwsduI0wQ,Tony Robbins,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6WqN7rF6KHk/mqdefault.jpg,PT1H5M20S,none,6190,292,21,latest

CoPs-Bk8M9Y,Business Was Hard Until I Learned This,"Download your free scaling roadmap here: https://www.acquisition.com/roadmap
The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

He is a six-time New York Times bestselling author, with titles including Crush It!, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, Twelve and a Half and Day Trading Attention.

The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

Lha52-dlBmk,Why You Should Care More (The Strategy No One is Talking About) w/ Pace Morby,"If you’re on social media then chances are you’ve seen this week’s Own Your Future guest… he’s blowing up. 

In this special Father’s Day episode of Own YOUR Future, I got to sit down with author, entrepreneur, investor, community builder and new friend Pace Morby, who seems to have come out of nowhere… 

But if you’ve been following me for a while, you know there’s no such thing as overnight success. 

Pace’s “secret to success” could be summed up in one line: “I win because I do what others won’t do, don’t do, can’t do.” 

Pace is the founder of Subto, an educational resource for experienced and novice real estate investors that teaches the freedom of creative financing in the United States. He’s host of A&E’s “Triple Digit Flip” and has built a wildly successful real estate empire. Pace is one of the most creative real estate investors out there. He’s also an amazing husband and father with a heart to serve. 

In fact, let me ask you… would you let a $1 million dollar bankruptcy letter stop you? 

Would you be willing to drive strangers around with you and show them HOW to make deals? 

Would you be willing to fail in front of those people and show them HOW to learn from that and keep moving forward? 

That’s exactly what Pace did. He put in the work and did what other people aren’t willing to do. It’s no wonder he’s created the amount of success he has today… he put people first. 

✌️ If you have been screwed over and want to learn how to turn that into something positive, this episode is for you. 
✌️ If you’ve had some success and still think you’re “not good enough,” this episode is for you. 
✌️ If you want to learn how to create a thriving community, this episode is a must listen! 
✌️ If you’re a mom or dad trying to balance building a business and being a parent, this episode is for you. 

I can’t wait for you to dive into this episode and hear Pace’s story. It is inspiring, encouraging, and a lesson in how important relationships are for achieving success in business at every stage of your journey.  

And if you learned something today… if we inspired you, motivated you, encouraged you in some way please share in the comments below and share this episode with someone you care about.

📲 Arayanlar arasında meslektaşlarım da vardı, marka sahipleri de.

Danışmanlığını yaptığımız bazı markalar da aynı sorunlarla biz de aynı şekilde boğuştuk.

Ama aynı zamanda, bilinirliği iyi olan ve bu yatırımı yapan markalarımıza baktığımızda ise sorunsuz ilerleyebildiğimizi de tecrübe ettik. ✅

Bunun 2 sebebi var:

💰 If you’re doing more than $10 million, click the link below to get on a quick 10-minute call with me for free: 🌐 https://tailopez.com/10minsyt

⚠️ Your ads aren’t converting because you’re making the same mistakes 99% of entrepreneurs make. I’ve run some of the biggest online ad campaigns in history, and I’m telling you—if your product isn’t a “high-appetite” product, it’s not going to sell. 🛑
“You can’t polish a turd 💩, and you can’t sell something nobody really wants.” 💡

✍️ Key Takeaways:
1️⃣ Test Your Product’s Appetite: Make your product feel essential—like oxygen to someone gasping for air. 
2️⃣ Target the Right Audience: Keep your market size reasonable and speak directly to your ideal customer. 🎯
3️⃣ Implement the 12-12-12 Framework: Test 12 ads at a time, run them for 12 days, and do 12 iterations to find your best performer. 🔄
4️⃣ Appeal to Narcissism: Make your customer feel like the ad is speaking directly to them—don’t make it too generic. 👀
5️⃣ Use the Parking Lot Test: If your product doesn’t make people chase after you for more info, it’s not appealing enough. 

💸 Struggling to scale your ads or spending over $1 million a year without seeing results?
I’m opening a few spots for one-on-one calls to help serious entrepreneurs fix their ad strategy—fast.

Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur and serves as the Chairman of VaynerX, the CEO of VaynerMedia, and the CEO and creator of VeeFriends. Gary is considered one of the leading global minds on what's next in culture, business, and the internet.

Known as ""GaryVee,"" he is described as one of the most forward thinkers in business. He acutely recognizes trends and patterns early to help others understand how shifts in consumer attention impact the realities of the business world today. Gary's approach sits at the intersection of business and pop culture. He keenly understands how to bring brand relevance to the forefront. He is a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase, and Uber.

Gary is an entrepreneur at heart – he builds businesses. Today, he helps Fortune 1000 brands leverage consumer attention through his full-service advertising agency, VaynerMedia, which has offices in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Toronto, Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, Delhi, and Kuala Lumpur. VaynerMedia is part of the VaynerX holding company, which also includes Eva Nosidam Productions, Gallery Media Group, The Sasha Group, VaynerSpeakers, VaynerCommerce, and Tingley Lane Trading. Gary is the Co-Founder of VaynerSports, VCR Group, VaynerWatt, ArtOfficial, Resy, and Empathy Wines. He guided Resy and Empathy to successful exits -- which he later sold to American Express and Constellation Brands, respectively. He also owns a Major League Pickleball team called the 5s, is part owner of a Big3 basketball team, and is an investor in the revival of the SlamBall League.

In 2021, Gary created VeeFriends, an entertainment company that has become a rising powerhouse in modern entertainment and collectibles. Often described as Pokemon meets Sesame Street, the company leverages stories, games, events, collectibles, and technology to scale its character universe. Vaynerchuk also has negotiated partnerships with brand powerhouses such as Crocs, Fanatics, Macy’s/Toys “R” Us, Mattel’s UNO, Mattel’s Masters of the Universe, Moonbug Entertainment, Reebok, Squishmallows, Topps, and more.

Gary is also the founder and creator of VeeCon – a contemporary super conference that converges business and pop culture with innovation and technology. He is a six-time New York Times bestselling author, with titles including Crush It!, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, Twelve and a Half and Day Trading Attention. In addition to running multiple businesses, Gary documents his daily life as a CEO through his social media channels, which have more than 45 million followers and garner more than 300 million monthly impressions/views across all platforms. His podcast, ""The GaryVee Audio Experience,"" ranks among the top podcasts globally.

Gary serves on the board of MikMak, Bojangles Restaurants, Global Citizen Forum and Pencils of Promise. He is also a longtime Well Member of charity: water.

RX7_6SQHQuI,Sound of Freedom: New Film Uncovers Scary Truths About Human Trafficking w/ Tim Ballard,"Did you know 6+ million children are enslaved? Worldwide there are estimates that as many as 27 million people don't own their bodies. 

Those are some terrifying statistics and it’s what keeps Tim Ballard going every day in the fight against human trafficking. 

Hands down, this is the most important interview Dean Graziosi has done to date. Dean sits down with former government agent turned freedom fighter, Tim Ballard about his mission to put a stop to human trafficking. 

Tim’s story is so dynamic that it’s been turned into a feature film, SOUND OF FREEDOM starring actor Jim Caviezel. It’s  a powerful story of heroism where good triumphs evil and justice wins.

SpznVVSS78Q,It's Time For Change | Gary Vaynerchuk Original Film,"I’m completely convinced that accountability is the most significant path to happiness. When you hold yourself accountable, it leads to solutions; it helps you maintain a position of control instead of being a victim. It excites me to know that nobody else is in control of my shit ... except me. If I created the issue, then I have the power to fix it. If I didn’t create the issue and it’s bigger than me or purely circumstantial, I can still decide how I absorb it.

Whatever is bothering you right now, take a step back, be grateful for what is going well, and realize what you can and can’t control. If you can’t control something, let it go and focus on what you can control, which is how much and how often you deploy gratitude in your life. It’s not just about having gratitude – you have to show it.

av89Yp8C4Ow,neden odaklanamıyoruz,"Sosyal medya seni sadece oyalamıyor, dikkatini sistemli bir şekilde çalıyor olabilir! Bu videoda Johann Hari’nin “Çalınan Dikkat” kitabından yola çıkarak, odaklanmanın neden bu kadar zorlaştığını ve dikkat ekonomisinin nasıl çalıştığını konuşuyoruz. Artık beynin neden sürekli yorgun hissediyor, neden ""bir işe başlayamıyorum"" diyorsun, anlayacaksın. Ama sadece teşhis değil, çözüm de burada.

b8_eyYZF44k,Are blog posts the best SEO strategy today?,"In the ever-evolving landscape of search engine optimization (SEO), one question continually arises: are blog posts the best SEO strategy today? While the answer may not be a simple yes or no, blog posts undoubtedly hold a prominent position in the arsenal of modern SEO practitioners. To understand their relevance, we need to examine the role of blog posts in today's digital marketing sphere and the factors that contribute to their effectiveness.

My Secrets To Creating an SEO Friendly Website: https://youtu.be/5I1hXX_xz7c
____________________________________________

First and foremost, blog posts are invaluable for SEO because they provide a platform for fresh and relevant content. Search engines like Google consistently prioritize content that is informative, up-to-date, and user-focused. Blog posts offer a flexible format to deliver this type of content. They allow businesses and website owners to share insights, updates, industry news, and other valuable information with their audience.

Moreover, blog posts are a means of targeting long-tail keywords and specific search queries. By crafting well-researched and informative blog posts around niche topics related to your industry or business, you can increase your chances of ranking higher in search results for these keywords. This targeted approach not only enhances your website's visibility but also attracts more qualified traffic.

Blog posts also foster engagement and interaction. They provide a platform for discussions, comments, and social sharing, which are important engagement signals for search engines. When readers engage with your content by commenting, sharing, or staying on your website longer, it sends positive signals to search engines, indicating that your content is valuable and relevant to your audience.

However, blog posts are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Their effectiveness depends on how they are crafted, optimized, and promoted.

Blog posts remain a powerful and versatile tool in contemporary SEO strategies. When executed effectively, they contribute to improving a website's visibility, attracting a targeted audience, and engaging users. 

However, the SEO landscape is dynamic, and it's crucial to adapt to changes in search engine algorithms and user preferences. 

Integrating blog posts as part of a broader SEO strategy, which includes technical SEO, on-page SEO, and off-page SEO, is a well-rounded approach to achieving success in today's competitive digital environment.

Most people fail not because they’re dumb—but because they wait too long.
In this video, I break down the #1 mindset shift that separates broke people from millionaires: SPEED TO ADAPT.

💡 What you’ll learn:
– Why perfection kills profit
– The 40/70 Rule used by generals, CEOs, and top entrepreneurs

The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

Today I'm revealing how to actually make money online—no gimmicks, no get-rich-quick scams, just real ways to make passive income, start a side hustle, and build online businesses that actually work. If you're tired of watching people flex their fake Shopify screenshots or promise ""easy money"" with no effort, this video is for you.

I've tested dropshipping, print-on-demand, affiliate marketing, digital products, and AI automation—and I know what works (and what’s a waste of time). In this guide, I’ll walk you through the exact steps to start making money online in 2025.

h9UyQiLjSHg,"Building a $3,500,000 Business for Two Strangers in 52 Minutes","Download your free scaling roadmap here: https://www.acquisition.com/roadmap
The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

Eckhart Tolle's TWO international bestsellers —The Power of Now and A New Earth —have been translated into 52 languages. Tolle has introduced millions of humans around the globe to the joy and freedom of living life in the present moment. 

The New York Times describes him as “the most popular spiritual author in the United States,” and Watkins Review named him “the most spiritually influential person in the world.”
 
Tolle’s profound yet simple teachings and benevolent essence (not to mention sweater vests) volunteer friendly encouragement to a state of inner peace in daily life. 

With teachings that focus on form identity vs. essence identity, the power of our present moment awareness, deep sensory perception, a pursuit of expanding consciousness, and the transcendence of the human stream of constant subconscious thoughts, Eckhart Tolle calls to all those who long to wake up.

This transcendence of mind and vibrant mental health could be the essential next step in all human evolution. We invite you to sit in the theatre of TONY AND SAGE ROBBINS | HAPPINESS CONFERENCE presented to their Platinum Partners in Sedona, Arizona. NOTE: This historic conversation took place through Zoom video and the enlightening lens of the year 2020. 

Immerse yourself in this profound knowledge and learn how to navigate life’s challenges and experience all that present moment mindfulness offers us. What would happen if you settle into a clarity of mind without problems or anxious thoughts? Listen in and life may never be the same again.

The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

Joseph Smith founded the LDS Church and this is the story of what followed: how mormons planned to expand into the west, how other prophets rose up and polygamy took over, the tension between them and the US government, and finally, how Utah came to be. This is part two of a three part series.

l21Z3a4oHdg,FROM $0 TO $20 MILLION: Tai Lopez's 67 Steps student Chris “Swaggy C” Williams,"📞 Text “Swaggy” and where you saw this video, plus a little about yourself and your current revenue, to +1 786-730-8374 via WhatsApp or SMS to get exclusive access to resources and my private community.

Most people want success in 3 months—and when it doesn’t happen, they call it a scam. But real wealth takes time, discipline, and the right knowledge. That’s exactly what Swaggy C understood when he took my 67 Steps program a decade ago.

Back then, he was broke in college with $2 in his account, watching my ad about a Lamborghini in my garage. Instead of skipping it like most people, he paid attention. He went through the 67 Steps, applied the knowledge, and now—10 years later—he’s a multi-millionaire. And we’re sitting in his Lambo, driving to his mansion, talking about life, money, and business.

In this episode, we break down:
✅ How The 67 Steps helped Swaggy C go from $2 to millions
✅ The mindset shift that separates winners from losers
✅ Why most people stay broke—and how to avoid their mistakes

o9qSf9wEuMo,ChatGPT gets banned - The 110M impression LinkedIn page,"In a digital world where artificial intelligence and machine learning have become integral components of our daily lives, the suspension or banning of an AI entity can stir up waves of intrigue and curiosity. Such was the case when the highly popular and influential LinkedIn page featuring ChatGPT, a cutting-edge AI language model, was banned. With a staggering 110 million impressions to its name, the ChatGPT LinkedIn page had garnered a massive following, making the ban a significant event in the realm of AI and online communication.

____________________________________________


However, the ban of ChatGPT's LinkedIn page raised several questions and sparked a lively debate. The circumstances surrounding the ban were initially shrouded in mystery, as there was no official statement from LinkedIn or the creators of ChatGPT. Speculation and conspiracy theories emerged, further fueling the intrigue.

One theory suggested that the ban was due to concerns about the influence of AI on social media platforms and the potential for AI-generated content to spread disinformation. Others speculated that the page's rapid growth and outreach had caught the attention of competitors who wanted to stifle its success.

The incident also prompted a broader conversation about the regulation and oversight of AI on social media platforms. As AI becomes increasingly intertwined with our online interactions, questions about transparency, accountability, and ethical usage have taken center stage. The ChatGPT ban served as a catalyst for these discussions, with experts and policymakers weighing in on the need for clear guidelines and regulations.

While the fate of the ChatGPT LinkedIn page remains uncertain, one thing is clear: its ban marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI and its role in online communities. As the AI landscape continues to expand and evolve, so too will the discussions and debates surrounding its place in our digital world, making the ChatGPT ban an event of historical significance in the realm of artificial intelligence.

tsqJuOsD-UE,"""This Is PROOF Your Beliefs Create Your Reality"" - Dr Bruce Lipton","Welcome to an eye-opening and timeless presentation from Dr. Bruce Lipton, a world-renowned 
cellular biologist and bestselling author celebrated for his groundbreaking work in epigenetics.

In this exclusive talk, recorded live at Tony and Sage Robbins' Platinum Spirituality Program in 
2020, Dr. Lipton presents “The Biology of Personal Empowerment.” He delves into how our 
beliefs and perceptions shape our biology, challenging the traditional view that our genes solely 
determine our fate. Instead, Dr. Lipton reveals how our thoughts, environment, and 
consciousness play a pivotal role in our health, as well as physical and emotional well-being.

Drawing from cutting-edge science and quantum physics, Dr. Lipton has uncovered a profound 
truth: what we once thought of as purely physical is actually energy in motion.

As Dr. Bruce Lipton says, “we are not victims of our genes, but masters of our fates, able to 
create lives overflowing with peace, happiness, and love.”

This episode will teach you how to master your perceptions and expand your knowledge so that 
you can transform your life.

Join us as we unlock the power of consciousness and learn how it can radically shift your health, 
mindset, and the way you interact with the world.  Enjoy!

uYds0zcAFWM,5 Things I Just Learned After 14 Years of Business,"Download your free scaling roadmap here: https://www.acquisition.com/roadmap
The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/games

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

New to Digital Marketing- 10 Essential Tips for a Strong Start: https://youtu.be/4abNIEHj-10
My Secrets To Creating an SEO Friendly Website: https://youtu.be/5I1hXX_xz7c
____________________________________________


One of the primary insights gleaned from these YouTube luminaries is the importance of authenticity. The top YouTubers have consistently demonstrated that being genuine and true to oneself resonates with audiences. Whether it's sharing personal experiences, embracing imperfections, or injecting humor into content, authenticity establishes a connection that goes beyond the screen, fostering a sense of relatability that is pivotal in building a dedicated fan base.

Consistency is another cornerstone emphasized by these YouTube trailblazers. From uploading schedules to thematic coherence, maintaining a consistent brand presence is crucial for audience retention and growth. The regularity of content not only cultivates a sense of anticipation among viewers but also strengthens the channel's visibility within the YouTube algorithm, contributing to enhanced discoverability.

Engagement, both with the content and the audience, is a lesson underscored by top YouTubers. They actively respond to comments, initiate conversations on social media, and create content that invites participation. This engagement not only forges a community around the channel but also provides valuable insights into audience preferences, aiding in the fine-tuning of content strategy.

Diversification emerges as a recurring theme among the YouTube elite. Successful creators adeptly explore various content formats, from tutorials and vlogs to collaborations and challenges. This diversity not only caters to a broader audience but also guards against monotony, keeping the content fresh and engaging.

The strategic use of keywords and SEO techniques is another facet that these YouTube maestros have honed. Crafting compelling titles, descriptions, and tags is not just about visibility; it's about understanding the audience's search behavior and aligning content with trending topics, ensuring that the channel remains relevant in the vast sea of online content.

Monetization strategies are an area where top YouTubers showcase their business acumen. Beyond ad revenue, successful creators explore sponsorships, merchandise, and other revenue streams. This diversified approach not only fortifies their financial stability but also serves as an inspiration for others looking to turn their passion into a sustainable career.

Collaboration is a key ingredient in the success recipe of top YouTubers. By teaming up with fellow creators, they tap into each other's audiences, expanding their reach and fostering a collaborative spirit within the community. These alliances amplify the entertainment factor while also opening doors to new opportunities.

Adaptability is a virtue that resonates in the narratives of top YouTubers. Whether it's adapting to changes in the YouTube algorithm or staying ahead of emerging trends, successful creators showcase an ability to evolve with the platform. This adaptability ensures that their content remains relevant and appealing to an ever-evolving audience.

The lessons derived from the practices of top YouTubers extend far beyond the confines of the platform. They serve as a blueprint for effective digital marketing strategies, emphasizing the pillars of authenticity, consistency, engagement, diversification, SEO optimization, monetization agility, collaboration, and adaptability. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, these lessons from the YouTube elite stand as a testament to the enduring principles that underpin successful content creation and marketing in the online realm.

media company with over three million subscribers and 100 million views a month! Codie also runs Contrarian Capital, a small business holding company that does $70 million in annual review and a venture fund focused on infrastructure for main street businesses.

Codie is on a mission to create 1 million small business owners. 

Have you ever thought about owning a laundromat or what about a car wash? Think about this, you drive by these things everyday and lots of them generate pretty considerable revenue! 

After watching this episode you might just be inspired to look at entrepreneurship differently because that’s how Codie got her start, she bought a laundromat. Now she teaches other people the power of entrepreneurship through buying boring businesses!

She’s taken her years from working in private equity and is bringing it to the people. She believes that if we can all help the next human get a little bit of equity, a little bit of ownership – that’s the whole game.

This episode will definitely get you thinking differently about what it means to be an entrepreneur. Make sure to leave a comment and let us know what you thought about this episode.

Tai also shares bonus insights like:
• Where in the world has the best farmland (U.S., Europe, Brazil?)

• How to bring a piece of the city with you to avoid culture shock
