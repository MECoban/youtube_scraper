{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "and that's why it's way more valuable"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "for you to write an email"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "than it is for you to write a tweet."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now, there's a few things"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "to generating majority of the sales"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "for that store, for that product."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So if you write a good video there,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "you can generate a lot of revenue,"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "And the problem here is that we don't want to be original."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We want to do what is proven to work."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You need to know what you're writing for or who you're writing to and in order to do that"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You need to understand the the big niches that we have when it comes to marketing when it comes to copywriting"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Customer you have to be very clear on who your target customer is in my case for the weight loss example"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's think who usually buy weight loss programs or go into weight loss diets who is interested in that?"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "That would be a very specific case and still broad enough for us to appeal to a lot of people"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But still be very specific with our communication to that specific target audience"}]}

Is it their face?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe it is their face. But for majority of the woman, where do they want to lose the weight from it's from their belly"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "If you want to start a business you start at because maybe we want to make an impact"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maybe we want to design a product you like those"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "But the main objective for majority of the people starting a business is to make money"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But then again how much money usually for every single desire outcome, whatever your target audience is"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "$10,000 a month because for them inside the target audience has had that represents their freedom"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay, so I want to use that little thing that represents their desired outcome in my communication"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "In that case is the $10,000 a month in the weight loss case is to lose belly fat again"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The more specific you're here the better"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So think about what is this specific thing for your target audience that represents their desired outcome and use that in your communication?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now to the third element here is a benefit"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So what's the benefit they can get on top of their desired outcome?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So for example for the weight loss scenario that could be okay, they're gonna lose three kilos of belly fat"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So the same thing for the other example that we have here"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "18 to 25 year old wanting to start a business and make $10,000 a month"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What can I add on top of that to make it even more enticing for that specific target audience?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I know that a problem they have not even a problem"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "But most like an objection that they have when it comes to starting a business is that they have no previous experience"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No previous work experience or no previous business experience"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So the added benefit I can add to the already existing promise in that case is that you can start a business"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's gonna make $10,000 a month without having to have any previous work experience"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So that's the benefit in that case and then after the benefit"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We are gonna go into the pain point the pain point and the benefits"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "They are two sides of the same coin and I'm gonna explain exactly why later in another module in phase two"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But they are very closely related. They're kind of like the same thing just moving different directions cool"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So the pain point here think about what is the biggest pain point people get or people go through?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When they are trying to achieve your desired outcome there when they're trying to have that experience"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the thing that sucks the most? It's the diet"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It is the diet"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "It's having to stick to a diet and having to one eat things that you don't like to not be able to eat things that"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You like right? So that's the biggest pain point"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "so what I can say here is that"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You don't have or even a third pain point would be that not only cannot eat the things you like you can only eat so"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Much you're always hungry. So those are the biggest pain points. What I can say here is that"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "By following this method, you don't have to go into starvation diets and you don't have to give up on your favorite foods"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So that would be the pain point is having to go through the diet having to go into"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "starvation and also having to give up on their favorite foods and then I can use that later on on my"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Promise to make it even better on the online business scenario. That would be having to invest money"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That's the number one pain point that people from 18 to 25 have because they don't have any previous work experience"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Which also means they probably don't have too much money laying around to invest up front"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So they first need to make money in order to have money and then a big objection"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "They usually have whenever you're pitching them something that requires them starting a businesses"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I don't have money to start a business to start with and that's the thing they're gonna have in their head when they're hearing"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Your promise. So it is very important that you address that pain point in your communication in order to handle those objections before they even come"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cool, so that's the pain point and the last thing you need is what I call a signature solution a signature solution"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "it's your specific name of your solution and"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why is this signature solution?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "The reason is not just any solution"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But a signature solution is because we want to have a specific name to our solution"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "That's gonna set ourselves apart from all the other competition"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So for example a few years back"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I remember I came across a diet protocol that was called the every other day diet"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And that's a very interesting name because it implies that you don't really need to diet every day"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You having to stick in the diet in the first place, right? So that's a very good name"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But I would do something differently here. I wouldn't call it every other day diet"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I would call it a every other day protocol"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why is that because if I call it a diet people are gonna automatically compare to every single order diet available out there"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So just from calling it a diet"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm creating competition for myself because then and deer has they're gonna compare it. So, okay"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I have this every other day diet, but there's also the ketogenic diet. There's a low carb diet. There's the"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Whatever is all the other diets available out there. They are gonna compare your solution to all the other solutions available"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So the purpose of our sanitary solution is to set ourselves apart and you can do that in very simple ways again"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The every other day diet already does that in its own?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "But just by changing the word diet from diet to protocol you accomplish that to an even higher level because now people are not gonna"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Automatically compare you to all the other diets available out there because you call yourself a protocol rather than a diet"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Right is the same with the the online business example"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I could call it the 45 days 0 to 10 K a month challenge and that would set myself apart from"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Category that you're putting yourself into is a challenge and people don't even have on their minds like oh"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There's a there are different challenges that I can be part of no"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "So you're setting yourself apart by just creating a different name for your solution"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And that's what you have to do just with those five elements"}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "When writing marketing copy,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "you must communicate in the common space"}]}
